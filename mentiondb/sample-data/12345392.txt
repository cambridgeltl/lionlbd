Realizing self-sufficiency. YKB clearly demonstrate the viability of fee-charging family clinics.
Yayasan Kusuma Buana (YKB) is an independent nongovernmental organization (NGO) which has developed and operates 6 family planning and maternal and child health clinics in Indonesia. The clinics target middle-lower income groups as a complement to free government services for comparatively poorer segments of society and the more expensive private services for the relatively more affluent. The presently self-sufficient Pisangan Baru clinic in East Jakarta was established in 1981 and is the oldest of all. It offers family planning and maternal and child health care services in the forms of maternity care, immunizations, and regular check-ups. Friendly and competent female midwives and support staff; short waiting times; the absence of sick and injured patients; bright and clean atmospheres; and affordable prices at YKB clinics attract and hold clients. Clients benefit by receiving quality services close to home at convenient times and lower prices than found in other clinics, while increasing clientele translates into higher wages for clinic staff. Staffs are comprised of midwives and administrative personnel along with doctors who work part-time. Midwives engage in activities which are far beyond the definitions of their jobs. They are health educators, counselors, motivators, and clinicians. In addition to clinical services, most clinics have outreach activities; some provide additional services such as 24-hour delivery service and clinical surgery; and the Pisangan Baru clinic even hosts an aerobics dance class which is open to members and nonmembers alike. All clinics, however, charge fees which are affordable to the majority of the community; offer longer service hours than public clinics; offer health education in many forms; and are maintained only in communities where available services are accepted and used.
