Women and family planning. "Now I will tell my daughters".
A Bolivian woman with three daughters became pregnant while practicing the rhythm method. Method failure occurred seven years after she bore her most recent child and prompted her, with her husband's consent, to obtain an unsafe abortion. The decision to abort the fetus was based upon her husband's lack of employment, the meager monthly income of US 45 which she earns, and the inability of her to continue working once pregnant. The abortion process consisted of a three-hour scraping/general cleaning which left the woman dizzy. She returned to the physician several days later, bloated and in pain, when the possibility of a perforated uterus was voiced and surgery conducted. The woman regrets having the abortion, for the couple wanted to bear a fourth child once they could afford it.
