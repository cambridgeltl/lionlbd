NIH statement on vasectomy and prostate cancer.
Evidence linking vasectomy to prostate cancer is conflicting. Experts who met at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in March 1993 to discuss the results of research to date, have issued a statement regarding future research. clinic and health practices, and vasectomy counseling. This is an amended version of that statement. First, because of inconsistent research findings and weak associations between vasectomy and prostate cancer, no change is recommended in clinical and public health practice. Providers should continue doing vasectomies; vasectomy reversals are not warranted to prevent prostate cancer; and screening for prostate cancer should be the same for all men; regardless of whether they have had vasectomies. Epidemiological and basic biological research is necessary to resolve questions concerning the relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer. Such studies should be integrated and international. Epidemiological studies, which should cover men aged 20 years or older after vasectomy, should address the following methodological limitations: selection bias, detection bias, and problems with ascertaining exposure (vasectomy) and outcome (prostate cancer). They should also address implications of current trends in screening. Biological research should be directed at the end etiology and the pathogenesis of prostate cancer in men and experimental animals and at the relationship between vasectomy and prostate pathology, function, and cancer.
