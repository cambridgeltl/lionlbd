Vaginal cytology after the menopause.
The methods by which oestrogen activity can be assessed cytologically are described. Hormone production does not cease with the onset of the menopause. In about 10% of post-menopausal women there is evidence of high oestrogenic activity until far into old age and in a further 40-45% moderate levels of oestrogens are maintained. Oestrogen administration should, therefore, not carried out routinely under the illusion that it constitutes preservation of youth, but should be reserved for such women in whom serious hormone deficiency can be demonstrated.
