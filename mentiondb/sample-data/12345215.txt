Working with women refugees in eastern Sri Lanka.
In 1991 in eastern Sri Lanka, Community Aid Abroad (funded by the Australian government) began a relief and rehabilitation program for refugees displaced by war in Sri Lanka. After the program organized people into groups and provided the essentials to start over, the men remained idle while the women assumed the burden of harvesting grain and caring for the families. After six months, the women indicated that they would like a portion of the available funds dedicated to agricultural loans instead of consumables. During the first season, women were able to grow enough food to meet the needs of their families and to generate income. After a year, the relief phase of the resettlement was over, and the women formed an organization to implement the second phase of the project. This experience points to the necessity and efficiency of working with women during times of war. Many women had become heads of household after their husbands were killed. Because of their family responsibilities, women were more able than men to cope with their changing roles. Engaging in collective and meaningful work helped the women overcome their trauma and develop self-reliance. Thus, war may result in women's greater empowerment, and women must be made aware of empowerment issues in order to solidify these hard-earned gains.
