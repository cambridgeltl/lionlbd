Mongolia. IEC guidelines elaborated to support MCH / FP project.
Information, education, and communication (IEC) guidelines for implementing the IEC component of the maternal and child health(MCH)/family planning(FP) project (MON/93/P01) of the Ministry of Health of Mongolia (the result of a mission by the CST for the East and South East Asia Adviser on Population Communication) target 3 groups: all women of reproductive age; adolescents and young adults aged 15-34 (36.7% of the total population); and children under 14 (41% of the total population). Government policy makers, legislators, administrators, school teachers, media practitioners, and health educators will receive IEC messages. Initial efforts will be in urban areas. The messages will cover reproductive health and hygiene, responsible sex, family life education, delaying marriage and first pregnancy, dangers of abortion, sexually transmitted disease (STD), safe motherhood, breastfeeding, child care, contraceptive methods, and misconceptions about family planning. Specific messages will be used for 5 high risk groups of women (those aged 20 or less; those older than 35; those with 4 or more children; those with children less than 2 years apart; and those 15-34 years of age). Messages will first be broadcast over radio and television and then confirmed, supported, and reinforced through use of print materials and face to face interactions with service providers. The proposed workplan includes activities on audience research; training on communication design; production of IEC materials, and planning and implementing IEC campaigns; IEC materials development and FP counseling workshops; newsletter production; and establishment of a Documentation Centre.
