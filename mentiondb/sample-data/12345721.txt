The quality assurance program in Indonesia.
An USAID-sponsored initiative has resulted in the development of a quality assurance (QA) model currently being implemented in several pilot hospital family planning programs in Jakarta and West Java. The model involves a team-based approach to problem-solving which encourages staff to take responsibility for the quality of care in their hospitals and provides them with the QA skills needed to effectively resolve problems. The Indonesian Association for Secure Contraception (PKMI) has periodically monitored and rendered technical support to seventeen hospitals involved in the QA effort, developing a reference manual which describes the basic concepts and techniques for implementing quality improvements. The manual has been used to develop training courses and materials in the approach. Training has to date consisted of hospital orientation seminars in the concepts of QA, basic skills training in the use of QA tools and techniques for hospital quality improvement teams, and specialized training for PKMI coaches or QA monitors. The one-day orientation seminars were targeted to hospital directors and general hospital staff to strengthen commitment and organizational support for quality. Basic skills training consisted mainly of lectures and small group exercises over the course of a five-day workshop, and was given to operational teams comprised of staff from the family planning program units in each hospital. The program also taught coaching and intermediate skills to strengthen the technical and facilitation skills of PKMI staff assigned to monitor hospital QA activities. Training design and sustainability issues raised and lessons learned from the training sessions are presented.
