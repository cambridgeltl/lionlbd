[The growing influence of external migration on Dutch population growth].
"In the last three decades, about one fifth of the population growth in the Netherlands was due to external migration. At the moment this is about one third and is still increasing. After 2020 mortality will be higher than fertility, but the positive net migration will cause some further growth of the population. This situation will last until about 2030. Thereafter the number of inhabitants will decrease." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
