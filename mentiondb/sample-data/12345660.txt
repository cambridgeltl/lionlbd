False precision and population science.
The author compares proponents of reducing population growth to alchemists and astrologers, thereby whole-heartedly dismissing the validity of the field of population science. His vitriolic essay argues thus: population science cannot predict the growth rate of human populations over long periods of time, population science can determine neither when nor how fertility rates will decline, only 10% of developing country populations are covered by reliable vital statistic registration systems, and population science has no scientifically precise definition of overpopulation. The images of disease, hunger, and overcrowding evoked by the notion overpopulation are instead due to poverty and material deprivation. Were delegates to the 1994 UN International Conference on Population and Development to address these real, latter issues, positive social change may result. Since conference attendees are, however, committed to a narrowly focused and flawed agenda, the world should dismiss conference policies as the nonsense that they are.
