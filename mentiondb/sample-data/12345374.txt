Safe motherhood and family planning.
The Guatemala Safe Motherhood Declaration, formulated at a 1992 regional conference, asserts, "Family planning is the key to reducing maternal mortality, since it enables women to choose how many children they wish to have, and the most opportune moment to have them." In the Central American region, there is a 1:73 risk of maternal mortality from pregnancy or childbirth-related causes. The Safe Motherhood Initiative has given family planning organizations, such as Guatemala's APROFAM, access to collaboration with sectors that have traditionally been opposed or indifferent to birth spacing. For example, the conference strengthened APROFAM's relationship with the Ministry of Health. The group became integrated in the national maternal-child health plan, consensus was reached on family planning coverage goals and contraceptive methods mix for each institution, and arrangements were made for Ministry staff to receive training in APROFAM clinics. The Ministry of Education's involvement led to the introduction of family life education into the primary and secondary school curricula. APROFAM is collaborating with the state university on research into maternal mortality risk factors and the establishment of a reproductive health clinic on the university campus. The Inter-American Parliamentary Group on Population and Development consulted with APROFAM on the design of a population law initiative that improves access to maternal-child health care. The Gynecology and Obstetrics Association is working with APROFAM to organize maternal mortality surveillance committees at the hospital level. Finally, greater linkages have been established with nongovernmental women's organizations committed to improving women's status--an important factor in maternal mortality.
