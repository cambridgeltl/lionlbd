Lessons for life.
Some policy makers, teachers, and parents believe that teaching young people about sex, sexuality, and contraception will encourage them to become sexually active earlier in their lives than they otherwise would. Comparing 35 sex education studies in the US, Europe, Australia, Mexico, and Thailand, however, the World Health Organization determined that sex education programs can actually encourage young people to postpone penetrative sexual intercourse or, if they are already sexually active, to reduce their number of partners or have safer sex. Programs which promoted a range of options were more effective in encouraging safer behavior than those which promoted abstinence alone, while better results were achieved from programs which introduced sex education before the young people became sexually active. Moreover, sex education works best if it is carried out with a positive attitude toward sexuality and sexual development; teaching merely the facts of life does not suffice. Teaching should help develop effective communication skills, responsible decision making, and self-esteem, and encourage each person to respect one's body and understand one's responsibilities to others. The role of schools in preventing HIV/STDs and encouraging the healthy sexual development of young people may be strengthened by developing policy, training all staff, integrating HIV education into the school curriculum, and establishing extracurricular activities.
