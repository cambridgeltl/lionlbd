The Ekwendeni approach.
In this short article, Dr. John Knowles of the Ekwendeni Hospital in Malawi describes his "multifactorial approach" to reducing maternal mortality, which was reduced at his church-run hospital, on average, from 383 deaths per 100,000 live births in 1979-1983 to 60 in 1984-1988. The weekly prenatal care clinic was supplemented by 10 monthly mobile clinics. This resulted in 98% of hospital deliveries receiving prenatal care. In the "antenatal awaiting shelter" or maternity waiting room provided, high risk mothers received health education that encouraged them to deliver in the hospital. New and better operating facilities, emphasizing sterility, were obtained when the hospital moved in 1986. Ambulance service was available for "Flying Squad" duties. Elective caesarean sections were scheduled for routine working hours when all services were available. Antibiotics were used aggressively, especially in cases of suspected puerperal sepsis and infected abortions. Culdocentesis was performed early in suspected ectopic pregnancies. Emphasis was placed on child spacing; services should lead to a smaller number of deliveries among women who have already had at least 4 deliveries. Besides financial constraints, the hospital faces 4 major problems: 1) socioeconomic factors affecting women's health; 2) an insufficient blood supply; 3) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the major cause of death in the 15-49 years of age group; and 4) poorly motivated staff who miss abnormalities and complications, so that patients are not referred to senior staff or larger units. This fourth problem is the most important. Dr. Knowles presented his findings at the northern regional meeting of the Medical Association of Malawi in June, 1989.
