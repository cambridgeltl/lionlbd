Extensive advertising. Turkey.
The Turkish Family Health and Planning Foundation set out with the support of the US Agency for International Development in 1988 to develop a contraceptive social marketing program. It was designed to increase the availability and use of condoms and low-dose pills, while maximizing the participation of the private sector. The program would build a market using existing infrastructure; collaborate and participate with 4 major pharmaceutical companies; use all commercial products and nothing donated; and negotiate for commercial product prices without subsidy. Full cost recovery and self-sufficient operation was projected to be realized by the 4th year of sales. The OK condom brand was created for the program and marketed through television, open air advertisements, gifts, and sponsorship from mid-1991. 4.46 million units were sold over the period May-December 1991 and 5.76 million over January-November 1992; these figures were 127% and 115% above sales targets, respectively. The OK brand dominated the market of everusers with 41.1% having employed the brand. Data suggest that the condoms are effectively being used by the urban and comparatively poor segments of society. Sales volumes were so robust that the commercial sector expanded the product line on its own to offer OK Extra.
