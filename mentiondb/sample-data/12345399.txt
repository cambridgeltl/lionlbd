Planning information provision: situations and needs as our point of departure.
Information, education, and communication activities in combination with provision of health services are necessary for any campaign against the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections and other sexually transmitted disease (STD). Emphasis on changing behaviors that are risky (multiple sex partners, unprotected sex, and sharing of injection equipment) is the starting point for these programs. In order to change behavior, the situations and needs of target populations, such as the handicapped and illiterate (groups who are often ignored, but who are often at risk for substance abuse and prostitution because of dependence on others for basic needs), need to be evaluated through focus group discussions, in-depth interviews with individuals, and interviews with key informants. Factors covered in the situation and needs assessment should include those affecting future intervention: motivations, fears, hopes, desires, actual practices, trusted sources of information, and the language used by the target groups on this subject. Peers sought by others for information should be used to disseminate appropriate information in this area. Materials should use the language used by the group. Members of the target population should be involved in planning and preparing information to be disseminated. Information materials and channels should be appropriate for the target group. For instance, materials should be in Braille for the blind. Visual symbols, discussion, and repeated testing can be used for the illiterate. The hearing or sight disabled, the learning disabled, and the illiterate function within existing communications networks within their communities. Once their concerns and environment are evaluated, program designers can reach them with effective communication materials, trained interpersonal communicators, and adequate practical and social support services.
