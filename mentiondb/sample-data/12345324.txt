Saving lives with menstrual regulation.
Although Bangladesh law permits induced abortion only to save the life of the mother, menstrual regulation is legally available. In 1978, a large-scale menstrual regulation training program was organized for government physicians and family welfare visitors. By 1983, there were 11 menstrual regulation centers and the procedure had become incorporated into the National Family Planning Program. At present, 22% of abortions in Bangladesh are performed in menstrual regulation centers. At least a third of the 24,000 deaths in Bangladesh each year from pregnancy-related causes are associated with septic abortions performed by untrained abortionists in the rural areas. Menstrual regulation offers a means to prevent many of these deaths; however, rural women are largely unaware of the availability of menstrual regulation and must be reached by field-level health and family planning workers with information about the safety of this method. In addition, women must be made aware that menstrual regulation can be performed only up to the 10th week of pregnancy (up to 8 weeks, if performed by a family welfare visitor).
