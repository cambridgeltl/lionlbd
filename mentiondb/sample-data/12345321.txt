Is life only precious at 20 weeks?
The experience of India demonstrates the insufficiency of abortion legalization without concomitant measures to make the procedure accessible, safe, and affordable. Abortion is permitted up to 20 weeks, and all 38 clinics of the Family Planning Association of India are equipped to perform the procedure at a cost of Rs60. However, services are inadequate to meet the demand in a context where abortion is the 4th most widely used method of fertility control. As a result, half a million Indian women die each year from complications of clandestine abortions performed by quacks. Parivar Seva Sanstha (PSS), the Indian affiliate of Marie Stopes International, is fighting to make abortion more accessible and to use the abortion visit to introduce effective contraception. Total reproductive care is provided by PSS at 31 clinics throughout India, and 3 mobile units travel to 65 villages. 80% of PSS clients accept family planning services. Subsidized treatment is available to abortion seekers unable to pay the nominal fee. The success of this program demonstrates the crucial role of abortion in family planning services.
