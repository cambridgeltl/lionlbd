[Demographic structures and urban fertility].
The authors analyze the interaction between demographic transition and rapid urbanization, two trends which currently predominate in Sub-Saharan Africa. The primary focus is on how urbanization affects the process of change to lower rates of fertility. The authors conclude that since new ideas generally spread from urban to rural areas, the predominant role that urban centers play in Tropical Africa is likely to encourage the process of demographic transition.
