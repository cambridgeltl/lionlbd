CCL and breast cancer.
A marked decrease in breast cancer occurs when a woman nurses a baby for 17 months or longer, and a more marked decrease occurs after 36 months of breast feeding. A study among Eskimos showed that continuous lactation from age 17 to age 50 affords protection from breast cancer. Breast feeding also results in small family sizes. Another study among the Tanka fisherwomen in Hong Kong revealed that these women only nursed on one side; when they developed breast cancers, 79% were on the unused side. Breast feeding is thought to prevent breast cancer because it reduces the number of times a woman ovulates during her lifetime. Breast cancer is also associated with oral contraceptive use and with abortions of first pregnancies. Women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by never taking oral contraceptives, never having an abortion, and nursing their children for extended periods of time.
