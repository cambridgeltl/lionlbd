High court gives states more freedom to require consent in teen abortions.
Mississippi legislation from 1986 dictating that pregnant, unmarried women under the age of 18 years must secure the consent of both parents in order to have an abortion was upheld in July 1993, by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals and the US Supreme Court. This is the most restrictive of state parental consent statutes. In the event that the pregnant woman's parents are divorced, unmarried, living apart, or if 1 parent is not available in a reasonable period of time, however, 1 parent may permit the woman to abort the fetus. Should the woman choose to submit herself to questioning before the court, the attending judge may allow her to have an abortion without parental consent if he or she finds the woman sufficiently mature or if he or she decides that it is not in the woman's best interest to tell her parents of the pregnancy. This lone, latter possibility to have an abortion without parental consent is known as a judicial bypass provision and is dependent upon the judge's whim. Judges lack consistent and reliable criteria for assessing individuals' abilities to make mature decisions, and it is certainly intimidating and traumatic for a woman to explain to a court why she should be allowed to exercise her right to choose to have an abortion. This latest action by the Supreme Court, however, is in keeping with its recent stance on the ability of parents and states to determine and restrict women's right to abortion. Parental control over the abortion rights of youths has been upheld by the Supreme Court in a series of 8 decisions over the past 17 years.
