Applying harm reduction to sexual and reproductive counseling. A health provider's guide to supporting the goals of people with HIV / AIDS.
HIV-positive individuals are often discriminated against in the health care system because of their sexual orientation and practices, especially when HIV-positive people are interested in conceiving, bearing, and raising children. Providers get uncomfortable and admonish or become angry with clients while possibly inflating their intent. After such encounters, clients often do not return to providers for future counseling. Fertility services should never be denied on the basis of socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, marital status, or HIV status. To that end, the author describes a harm reduction model approach most often used with injection drug users. Harm reduction is a philosophy in which the professional health care provider sets aside all judgements in order to meet clients at their own level regarding a problem or crisis. The professional also commits to help the client with technical information toward achieving the client's goal. The setting aside of judgements allows clients' goals to be considered and entertained without bias. After all, we all engage in risk-taking behaviors. Harm reduction techniques improve client/provider relationships and allow an opportunity for intervention. The model will facilitate providing support for achieving healthy sexual and reproductive responses in HIV-positive clients. The author discusses the harm reduction model in sexual counseling, applying the technique, initiating discussions regarding childbearing goals, and interventions for heterosexual couples, single women/lesbians, lesbian couples, single men/gay men, and infertility work-ups.
