[Francophone migratory flows between Quebec and Ontario: toward spatio-linguistic polarization?].
"The link between linguistic mobility and spatial mobility is investigated through the analysis of francophone migratory flows between Quebec and Ontario during the 1981-1986 period. Using 1986 census data, the analysis shows that these flows are indeed part of a more polarized spatio-linguistic situation. However, the results also show that this phenomenon is closely related to another one, that is to the return migration flow toward Quebec. Due to this relation, the role of Quebec as a true migration pole for French population outside Quebec is more problematic." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
