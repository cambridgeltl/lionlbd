Public focus on safe motherhood in Pakistan.
Public attention is being focused on safe motherhood in Pakistan as a result of community meetings about the causes of maternal death. The Mother and Child Welfare Association of Faisalabad holds the meetings -- called "maternal death meetings" -- to stress the community's role in preventing maternal death. Since January 1989, the welfare association has been compiling details of all maternal deaths in the city of Faisalabad. There were 48 recorded maternal deaths in 1989, 55 in 1990, 41 in 1991 and 37 in 1992. The association interviews relatives of the deceased mother, physician or TBA to find out the cause of death and any avoidable factors. The aim is to discover just how preventable the death was and what measures should be taken to prevent a death like that in the future. The maternal death meetings point out how appropriate actions of mothers, TBAs and relatives as well as of medical professionals can contribute to preventing maternal deaths. Women get information and advice about maternal health and family planning at the meetings. The association's president, Professor Altaf Bashir, says the meetings have increased public awareness of the problem and made women and TBAs more aware of the damage done by certain practices to speed delivery.
