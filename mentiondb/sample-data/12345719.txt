[Regional frequency of lung cancer and COLD-mortality].
"The study analyses regional differences of lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease [COLD] mortality in 61 Hungarian towns between 1980 and 1989. The result of regional clustering with [the] Monte-Carlo method shows that regional distribution of lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease mortality is not random. Whereas the mortality rates by age group and sex hardly show correlation with air pollution data between 1980 and 1989, they are much higher in more industrialised areas than elsewhere."
