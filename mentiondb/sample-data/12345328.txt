RU 486: new hope for women.
Although abortion has been legal in India since 1971, there are an estimated 2-10 times as many illegal as legal terminations, and sepsis resulting from abortions performed by nonqualified practitioners is a major contributor to maternal mortality. Continued reliance on illegal abortion is believed to reflect fear of surgery and anesthesia, a lack of access to abortion clinics, and social and cultural factors, especially a lack of confidentiality and privacy. RU-486 offers the potential to overcome these obstacles and extend the availability of safe abortion to Indian women. At present, 2 clinical trials are underway in India to test the acceptability and effectiveness of RU-486 with prostaglandins in various doses. In the 78 cases reviewed to date, compliance was 96%, acceptability was 83%, and 97% had a complete abortion. All but 1 participant indicated she would select RU-486 if a subsequent unwanted pregnancy occurred. Reasons given for preference of this methods included the lack of pain and discomfort, no need for hospital admission or surgery, and the protection of privacy. Use of a single 200 mg tablet has been found to reduce side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. More research is needed, however, to identify the optimum minimal effective does in India's many anemic, malnourished women.
