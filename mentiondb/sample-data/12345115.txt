[Population forecast for Hungary, 1993-2020].
"The author discusses the results of [an] age-specific technical population forecast up to 2020, based on the latest available population and vital statistics [for Hungary]. The forecast starts from population figures as at 1 January 1993, that have been statistically updated from the 1990 census data, and it assumes that indicators of demographic trends (fertility, mortality) of 1992 will remain unchanged in the period between 1993 and 2020."
