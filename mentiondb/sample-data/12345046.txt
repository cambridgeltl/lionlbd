[Foreigners and natives in Switzerland: demographic divergence and convergence].
The native and immigrant populations of Switzerland are examined and compared. "The latter represents today 18% of the total population and its age structure tends to draw nearer to that of the Swiss by an aging process. The sex ratio is much different in the two communities. In fact, the foreign population has a strong masculine predominance, especially among the holders of short duration permits. In addition, the diminution in the number of Italians and Spaniards goes with the arrival of the new nationalities (Yugoslavs, Portuguese and Turks) in the labour market and one can observe, as for the Swiss, that the foreign labour, generally speaking, joins more and more the tertiary industries."
