Rate of increase of AIDS alarming.
HIV infection had been diagnosed in thirteen Pacific Island countries/territories by January 1994. The cumulative reported number of HIV cases is 458, with 165 AIDS cases spread over eleven countries/territories. The number of AIDS cases per 100,000 people in Pacific Island countries increased by 500% between 1989-93. Guam, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia report the highest rates of HIV infection. The South Pacific Commission's epidemiologist holds that the number of HIV/AIDS cases in the Pacific Islands is increasing at an alarming rate and notes the 29% increase in the number of notified AIDS cases in the region since December 31, 1993, compared to the same period in 1992. Under-reporting of HIV/AIDS cases in the region means that the situation is probably even worse that we know. An epidemic of truly disastrous proportion will result if rates of HIV infection continue to climb.
