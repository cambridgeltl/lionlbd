Sports against AIDS.
Western Samoa's Chief Health Educator is using the Manu Samoa football team to promote AIDS prevention and anti-smoking among Samoans. Not only are young athletes at risk of contracting and transmitting HIV, they also tend to be highly regarded by other members of society. The Educator conducted a workshop for the team when they were ready to go to Hong Kong to stress the need for safer sex and demonstrate how to use the condoms. The event as reported in Samoa Sports is included in the paper.
