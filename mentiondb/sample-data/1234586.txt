[Selection in Polyporus versicolor of mutants producing laccase].
Following preceeding research on the production of laccase in Polyporus versicolor the A. has studied the various cultural conditions which are favourable to a good production of the enzyme. By selecting U.V. induced mutants it has been possible to isolate strains with a high production of the enzyme, in which the enzyme is either constitutive or inducible.
