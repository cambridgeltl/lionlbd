A global picture. Overview.
To be effective and acceptable, family planning programs must directly confront sexual and reproductive health needs. In turn, this requires creation of an environment conducive to raising and discussing questions in this area through the provision of education, counseling skills, and support to staff. At greatest need of attention to sexual issues are unmarried women under 20 years of age. Over 50% of young women in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America give birth before the age of 20 years, and pregnancy-related complications are the leading cause of death among teenagers in these regions. Unsafe abortion is especially prevalent among Latin American teenagers, but is preventable through sexual and contraceptive education and services and the legalization of safe abortion. In addition, family planning programs have a responsibility to promote condom use among young girls to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and the sequelae of pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and greater susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus infection. Finally, family planning programs in Egypt and parts of Africa must make the elimination of female genital mutilation an integral effort given its tremendous threat to women's physical and psychological health.
