Is the best yet to come?
With the technological and technical knowledge we have at hand, humans can either abolish poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, hunger, and unemployment within the next 2 decades or destroy all life on the planet through a nuclear holocaust, slow starvation, or environmental destruction. Our current transition to a global society is the most difficult we have ever attempted and requires the structuring of a global consciousness. Population stabilization will be one of the key factors in developing sustainability because all of the current problems which face mankind, from rampant disease and pandemics, deforestation, desertification, environmental degradation, to social tensions and societal conflicts, can be traced to population pressure. In order to control population growth, we need more research and development in effective, noninvasive methods of family planning. In fact, if the Western pharmaceutical companies have abandoned development of an antipregnancy vaccine, then scientists in the developing world should work towards achieving this major breakthrough. Once the availability of various contraceptive methods is secured, the mass media, especially television and radio which allow messages to be taken to every home, should be used to motivate people to use contraception. Religious leaders must also become involved in this motivational campaign because they will have a major impact on the acceptance of contraception. These ideas are elements of the type of World Population Plan which must be structured during the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and which can be carried out by using only a fraction of the funds available through the "peace dividend." The human race is capable of developing more nuclear warheads than it could ever detonate; surely we can adopt sane and enlightened policies which will allow us to share the resources of the world to everyone's advantage.
