Vast differences.
There are many islands in the South Pacific, each with its own population, socioeconomic, and cultural concerns and interests. The Secretary-General of the South Pacific Forum and former president of Kiribati stresses the need to consider population growth and size as well as population distribution. In the island countries of the Pacific, some populations reside in remote, rural areas, while others inhabit densely-populated, urban settlements. Both situations present different problems for the provision of services and for bringing about social and economic development. Current political and economic relationships establish the direction of population movement in the South Pacific, while the level of social and economic development and the existence of established kinship networks provide the means of migration. Evidence points toward an increasing level of urbanization in the region. To a lesser extent, there is also movement between islands and between rural areas on the larger islands. While migrants to more developed areas may earn better standards of living and send remittances home, second generation migrants may not find steady employment unless there is growth in economic opportunity in urban areas. Remittances will also likely decline as decision-making responsibility shifts to younger generations. Governments need to focus greater attention on these issues.
