[A neoclassical four-sector model for estimating the structural effects of liberalization of the labor market].
"This paper describes the basic set-up of a macroeconomic model disaggregated into 4 sectors. The purpose of the model is to analyze the structural effects of immigration policy. In a first section, the working of the model is illustrated by computing multipliers for various exogenous changes. In particular, the sensitivity of the multipliers with respect to the parameter values is discussed. The next section deals with the incorporation of the labour market and presents some simulation results based on theoretically plausible parameter values." The geographical focus is on Switzerland.
