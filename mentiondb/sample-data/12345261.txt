Aging of the population and spending patterns in Canada 1984 and 1986.
"From the data contained in the 1984 and 1986 Surveys of Family Expenditures, which were carried out by Statistics Canada...this paper examines the consumption patterns of those households where the head is under 60, those 60-74, and those 75 and over. The first examination is of disaggregated expenditure patterns. Compared with household heads under the age of 60, those between 60 and 75 spend proportionately more on food and shelter, and smaller proportions on clothing, household operations, household furnishings, and recreation. These differences are accentuated when the household head is older than 75. The analysis is also done controlling for such variables as education, region, marital status, sex of household head, place of birth, and language." (SUMMARY IN ITA)
