AIDSCAP in Asia.
Family Health International's AIDS Control and Prevention Project (AIDSCAP) has programs in Bangkok, Nepal, India, and the Philippines, and will soon begin to support a 5-year HIV prevention project in Indonesia. Most programs combine communication to encourage the practice of safer sexual behavior, the prevention and improved treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), and condom promotion and distribution. In the Philippines, AIDSCAP works with the Department of Health to strengthen STD services. AIDSCAP works closely in each country with the government, local nongovernmental organizations, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) missions, and other donors to coordinate assistance. AIDSCAP also supports USAID field missions in Bangladesh, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka by identifying ways to slow the spread of HIV. The project has identified the Thai-Laos border, the South Pacific Islands, and the major truck routes between Calcutta and Kathmandu as areas in which countries share a common HIV/AIDS problem.
