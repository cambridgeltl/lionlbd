Fidelity, mutual respect best shields against AIDS.
With their failure rate of 15-18% in teenagers, condoms are a risky form of contraception. In addition, if they fail to prevent pregnancy, they can also fail to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS and chlamydia. Despite propaganda which touts condoms as cure-alls, a third of sexually active teenagers will acquire a sexually transmitted disease before they graduate from high school. Teenagers should practice sexual abstinence instead of "safe" sex. They should learn self-respect and self-control rather than sort-of-safe self-indulgence.
