Just one baby.
A 17-year-old pro-choice activist relates the experiences of a day spent outside of an abortion clinic trying to persuade women to forego the procedure. After 3 weeks, she had been unable to avert a single abortion, but on this day she made a special prayer to save just one baby, and she was successful in counseling a mother to take advantage of the resources offered to help her keep her baby. The pro-choice activist recalls her thoughts and feelings 7 months later when she met the baby.
