Acceptance speech.
In Bangladesh, the head of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) gave an acceptance speech at an awards ceremony celebrating the key role of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) in the discovery of oral rehydration solution [ORS]. UNDP has worked closely with ICDDR,B since 1978. The UNDP leader praised ICDDR,B for its role in ORS development and also praised the government and people of Bangladesh for maintaining an environment in which ICDDR,B can succeed. He also recognized BRAC for its role in distributing information about ORS, resulting in ORS becoming a household item in Bangladesh. 10 years ago, just the scientific community knew about ORS. Today, 33% of families in developing countries uses ORS. Every family can prepare this inexpensive intervention that saves millions of lives each year at home. ORS represents the type of appropriate technology we all need to achieve sustainable human development. Around 95% of rural and urban mothers in Bangladesh know about ORS. 68-77% have used it to treat childhood diarrhea. Nevertheless, diarrhea still claims millions of lives each year, showing the need to make further progress in human development. We must extend our boundaries of knowledge, the generation of new technologies, and better delivery systems. Promotion of household food security is needed to thwart malnutrition, which is directly associated with diarrhea.
