[Problems of population in Tibet].
"The debate on Tibet's population and population issues is not a new one in the demographic literature. Drawing on the data of recent population censuses in China the author of the study gives a review of the problems. He uses documents--issued mostly in English--by means of which he can get a better insight into the reasons of the lack of data and into the assessment of the available data." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
