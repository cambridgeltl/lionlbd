Informed consent plays key role.
Contraceptive research is conducted in developed and developing countries with the objective of developing safe and acceptable contraceptive methods and improved family planning programs. Volunteers who participate in biomedical and social science research in the field of family planning may, however, be at risk since some of the effects of new drugs, devices, or programs are unknown. It is imperative in such research that volunteers be informed and protected in terms of their health, safety, well-being, rights, and privacy. The responsibility for conferring such protection lies with the organizations which are sponsoring the research. International guidelines and safeguards exist to prevent research participants from being taken advantage of, but the integrity and commitment of researchers is the most essential element. Experts say that communicating all necessary information about the research to participants and obtaining their voluntary informed consent are important protection measures. Ethical review before research and communication between investigators and staff who conduct studies are also important. Contraceptive research, informed consent, the history of consent arising in response to Nazi experimentation upon prisoners in concentration camps during World War II, consent in practice, and improving the protection of volunteers are discussed.
