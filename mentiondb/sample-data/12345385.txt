Client satisfaction.
Yayasan Kusuma Buana (YKB) was established in 1980 as an independent nongovernmental organization to promote private sector involvement in urban family planning in Indonesia. It specifically aimed to establish 10 fee-for-service family planning clinics in Jakarta and develop training programs to strengthen the service delivery capacities of private family planning providers. YKB actively promotes its services in the community and lays claim to having 2 clinics which have become financially self-reliant. Central to YKB's successful approach is the offering of services at times and locations which are convenient for clients. The midwives and other personnel treat clients decently and warmly, and make every effort to attend to both medical and emotional needs. High-quality, low-cost services are provided in a client-centered manner. Short exit interviews provide managers with data on the ongoing innovation process of the operation. YKB is currently considering how to expand its vision and programs.
