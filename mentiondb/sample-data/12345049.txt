[How immigration influences the national economic system of host countries: an empirical investigation for Switzerland].
"The study deals with the distributional effects of immigration into Switzerland. Focusing on the governmental budget, it explores empirically whether resident foreigners are a burden or a benefit for the Swiss public transfer system. The estimation is based on the Consumer Survey 1990 by the Swiss Statistical Office. It is shown that in 1990 the presence of foreigners has not put additional strain on the public coffers, but that, on the contrary, there was a beneficial financial effect for the natives. An analysis of this profitable immigration result shows the influence of the variables age (negative), number of children (negative), household income (positive) and qualification (positive)."
