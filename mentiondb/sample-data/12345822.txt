Safe motherhood partners: the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
The objective of one international research program at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is to evaluate methods of measuring maternal health. A study under the direction of the Maternal and Child Epidemiology Unit during 1991-95 evaluated different sources of information on maternal health and identified ways of obtaining reliable information directly from women themselves. Initial research activity during 1989-91 provided background information on measurement issues and was followed by field research. The third phase is just beginning and will focus on the effectiveness of maternal health services in developing countries. The evaluation will pertain to quality of care issues and the success of interventions in preventing maternal deaths and serious morbidity. The program claims to be the only major research initiative focusing on measurement-related issues in maternal health. The field studies in the second phase were conducted in Bangladesh, Egypt, Nicaragua, and Turkey. Research in Bangladesh focused on maternal morbidity during delivery and postpartum and its determinants. In Egypt, one national study identified avoidable factors in maternal mortality. Another aimed to determine prospectively the patterns of care among pregnant and postpartum women in Assuit in Upper Egypt. In Nicaragua, research determined the level and determinants of maternal mortality. Turkish research was concerned with the role of reproductive morbidity in contraceptive usage.
