Working on gender in conflict situations: some ideas on strategy.
During times of conflict, development agencies must rely on the relationships they have built with local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to seek effective strategies for working on gender issues. In such critical times it is easy to falsely consider the needs of gender equity as secondary to other goals, yet the community at risk will be constrained in achieving other goals if gender inequities exist to impede progress. Raising gender issues with local NGOs can result in strengthened relationships if this is done as part of a long-term strategy. Ad hoc attempts to deal with gender issues, however, can weaken relationships. A strategy for working with local NGOs on gender and conflict may include: 1) joint training workshops, 2) strengthening ties with women's organizations, 3) networking, 4) research, 5) creating a resource-base, 6) training specialist gender staff to integrate gender into technical issues, 7) joint planning, 8) provision of technical resources, 9) establishing dialogues on gender, and 10) seeking allies among influential people in the community.
