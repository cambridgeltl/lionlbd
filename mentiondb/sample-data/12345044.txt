[Economic consequences of migration for the domestic labor market].
"The purpose of this study was an evaluation of the labor market consequences of immigration. The European countries had substantial experiences with labor migration in recent years. The various theoretical channels how natives might be affected by foreign labor are discussed, especially the issue whether natives and foreigners are complements or substitutes. Most empirical studies for the U.S. confirm that the employment and wage processes of natives are hardly affected. However, recent investigations for Germany qualify these findings."
