White and West Indian infants in London: development from birth to 44 weeks of age.
Fifty white and 50 West Indian babies were examined on four occasions between birth and the age of 10 months. The West Indian babies were significantly advanced over the white babies when newborn, but by 6 weeks of age were losing their advantage; there were no significant differences at 6 months and 10 months of age. The ethnic origin, growth pattern, feeding customs and relevant socioeconomic factors were considered and the implications discussed.
