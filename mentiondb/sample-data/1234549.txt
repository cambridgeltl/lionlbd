Effect of bombesin on pancreatic secretion and gall bladder motility of the chicken.
Bombesin strongly stimulated the chicken pancreatic secretion. When given by i.v. infusion, the threshold dose was of the order of 7.5-45.0 ng/kg/min and maximum enzyme output was obtained at a rate of 60 ng/kg/min. In addition to total enzyme output, enzyme concentration was also increased. Caerulein displayed a more potent stimulant effect, but composition of juice produced by the two polypeptides was similar. Tachyphylaxis occurred only with bombesin. Neither atropine nor gastric acidification affected the response to bombesin. Bombesin was totally ineffective in promoting gall bladder emptying. It is suggested that in the chicken, bombesin acts on the exocrine pancreas indirectly through release of an endogenous pancreozymin possibly devoid of cholecystokinetic activity.
