Sexual and reproductive health is our business.
The Family Planning Association of Trinidad and Tobago (FPATT) has decided that integration of the concept of sexual and reproductive health into regular family planning activities is the best way to increase the contraceptive prevalence rate. A more holistic approach to service provision is being developed. On the basis of survey findings that early sexual activity, low contraceptive use, and limited knowledge are widespread among young people, this population group has been selected as a focus. FPATT has asked for a TT 1 million subsidy to intensify sex education programs in the schools. Issues discussed include human sexuality, values clarification, relationships, problems affecting teenagers, parenting, rape and incest, and family planning. FPATT also conducts training sessions for teachers and parents. Since young people tend to respond best to peers, peer counseling is emphasized. Education is also offered at large industrial sites, private homes in small communities, and government health centers.
