Bacteriological diagnosis of tuberculosis in children.
Bacteriological diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in children is not as easy as simply observing or culturing sputum, since children rarely expectorate TB organisms; instead direct smears of other specimens may be possible, or culture is attempted. The most common locations of TB in young children were primary infections of mediastinal nodes, pulmonary infections with or without cavitation, or extrapulmonary infections of the pleura, joints, pericardium, peritoneum, or elsewhere. In most cases, drug treatment must be started before culture results are returned. Specimens of suspected pulmonary TB are taken by gastric lavage or laryngeal swab in early morning, or by induced coughing, with protection for health workers. Specimens can also sometimes be obtained from urine, open lesions, puncture of the pleura, cerebrospinal fluid, or ascites. Smears for TB are stained with Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast technique or auramine fluorescent strain. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be cultured directly on Lowenstein-Jensen medium, if a pure culture is anticipated, as from cerebrospinal fluid. If the organisms are mixed with normal flora, they can be selected by pretreatment with 4% NaOH or a detergent. There are highly technological methods for isolating and identifying M. tuberculosis, such as radiometric culture techniques, or assaying tuberculostearic acid, both of which require expensive equipment, and methods still in research and development, such as an ELISA and a DNA probe.
