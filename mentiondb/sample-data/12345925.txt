Maternal manifestations of malaria in pregnancy: a review.
Malaria is a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality, and this risk is highest in the areas of unstable malaria transmission. In 1990 and 1991 the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Sir Sayajirao General Hospital in central Gujarat, India, has cared for a total of 445 urban as well as rural patients with malaria in pregnancy: 232 were labor ward admissions and 213 were antenatal ward admissions. Plasmodium falciparum infection affected 97.27% of patients, both primigravidae and multigravidae. Heavy parasitemia was observed in 27.14% of primigravidae and 48.57% in secundigravidae, however, this was not statistically significant. Out of the 260 (58.42.) cases who had various degrees of anaemia, 59 (22.69) had severe anaemia with haemoglobin of less than 6.0 gm O/dl. Within this group, 71.16% women were primigravidae or secundigravidae, the rest were multigravidae. Out of the 6 patients in first trimester, the miscarriage rate was 100%. In the second trimester, out of 52 patients 74.99 pregnancies were discontinued, whereas in the third trimester, the miscarriage rate was 18.17%. This observation was statistically significant (p 0.05). 178 patients who were admitted antenatally were discharged, their pregnancy outcome was not known, and accordingly they were excluded. There were 11 patients in the first trimester, 139 in the second trimester, and 295 in the third trimester. The known pregnancy losses were 54.54% in the first trimester. 28.05% in the second trimester, and 12.88% in the third trimester. 75.59% of those with minor parasitemia and 47.36% with heavy parasitemia had a normal pregnancy outcome. The overall fetal loss was 31.08%, which was almost twice that of the miscarriage rates among the general population. Maternal deaths attributed to malaria in pregnancy were 15, with cerebral malaria accounting for 5 deaths. 46.66% of the deaths occurred in primigravidae and secundigravidae. The other causes of mortality were postpartum hemorrhage, acute pulmonary edema, and hypoglycemia.
