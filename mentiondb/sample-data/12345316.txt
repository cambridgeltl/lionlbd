The need for reform.
Liberalization of the abortion law and improved family planning services are essential to protect the health and lives of Chilean women. Due to strong Catholic Church influence, abortion is illegal in the country. Family planning is available, but clinic staff have been cut dramatically by the government, meaning that poor women lack ready access to effective contraception. In 1990, the number of women hospitalized for treatment of complications of illegal abortion was 44,500. In part, increased resort to unsafe abortion has been precipitated by increased family size resulting from dramatic declines in infant mortality (18.1 in 1990). In response to pressure from Chilean physicians, the Ministry of Health has instructed hospitals and clinics to provide information about contraception to all women and to offer free supplies of reversible methods. The wider use of contraception resulting from this intervention has reduced the number of hospitalizations for abortion, but clandestine abortions remain an urgent national health problem.
