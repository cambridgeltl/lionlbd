Health services fail women who suffer unsafe abortion.
Physicians, medical schools, and health systems are failing, respectively, to provide the treatment, training, and facilities necessary for proper care of women suffering from the complications of unsafe abortions. Family planning services, also, are failing to reach the women at risk. Thousands of women are dying because of this. In some countries, unsafe abortions may account for as many as half of maternal deaths; however, due to social attitudes, information is hard to obtain. The report of the World Health Organization Technical Working Group on the Prevention and Management of Unsafe Abortion has been released. This report states that treatment of these complications should be extended throughout the health care system; more training and facilities, especially at the primary care level, are necessary; physicians should give higher priority to complications due to unsafe abortions; "punitive attitudes" or health care workers should not effect treatment; more research on the management of complications of unsafe abortions and on the use of contraception after abortion is necessary; family planning advice and assistance should be offered after treatment for complications; and family planning services should be designed with women's preferences in mind. The report also lists tests, treatments, and services necessary at primary care and first referral levels for women with complications from unsafe abortions.
