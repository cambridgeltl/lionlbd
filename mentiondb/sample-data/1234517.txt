Microwave radiometry and its potential applications in biology and medicine: experimental studies.
This paper presents experimental data on : (1) the natural emission of microwave radiation by biological systems, and (2) the effect of drugs as well as microwave radiation on specimen microwave emission. Experiments were conducted on guinea pigs, mice, rabbits, and human subjects. The results were obtained with two different radiometers, one of the correlation type and one of the Dicke type, operating in the X-band at about 9 GHz with a sensitivity of approximately 0.1 degrees K. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this technique and suggestions are made for its use in bilogy, medicine, and in the field of biocommunications.
