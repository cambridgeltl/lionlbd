[The difficulties in evaluating the integration of migrants].
"Migrations in Europe have changed significantly in the last three decades, both in scope and nature, and involving new countries. It is therefore necessary to reconsider the concept of integration and the ways to measure it. It must also be taken into account that migration matters cannot be dealt with within national units, but require coordinated, agreed upon policies in countries (or even greater units) of origin and destination. The particular case of Italy with a large quantity of emigrants abroad and an important incoming flow of new immigrants is considered especially. Also the difficulties and possibilities of an accurate estimation of Italians abroad are analyzed." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
