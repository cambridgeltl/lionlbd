Why natural family planning and not contraception?
The principal of the end not justifying the means is used to respond to the question of why the Catholic Church permits the practice of natural family planning (NFP) but not the use of contraception. NFP is morally different from contraception. The entire Christian Church rejected contraception until 1930 when the Church of England endorsed its use in cases of extreme hardship. In December of that year, the Pope recognized the licitness of NFP. The current Pope explained the difference by saying that NFP uses a faculty given by nature whereas contraception impedes nature. The contracepting couple simultaneously engages in sex and an act to counter the results of sex, whereas the NFP couple engages in sex when they know it will not result in children.
