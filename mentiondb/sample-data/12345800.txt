United Nations moving ahead on consolidation of AIDS programs.
The HIV/AIDS pandemic has many different biomedical, behavioral, and policy aspects. These aspects must be balanced and coordinated to best fight the spread of infection and disease. The Joint and Co-Sponsored UN Program on HIV/AIDS is expected to be fully functional by January 1996 and will link the AIDS-related activities of WHO, the World Bank, UNESCO, UNDP, UNICEF, and the UN Fund for Population. The consolidation is envisaged as a central resource to which member organizations can turn for funding and guidance in policy and scientific research, effectively getting research results applied more readily where they are most urgently needed. UN officials expect the unification of AIDS study programs to significantly enhance laboratory research and other efforts to combat the disease worldwide. The program, with a projected budget of  100 million to support global-level efforts, has yet to set an agenda other than the overall objective of working at the global and national levels to check the spread of AIDS. While researchers, public health specialists, policy officials, and others inside and outside of the UN may differ in their opinions on what are priority issues in the battle against AIDS, they nonetheless concur that urgent, concerted action is called for.
