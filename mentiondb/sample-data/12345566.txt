A future for social policy in Asia.
Social progress has lagged behind economic progress in southeast Asia. Recent research, however, indicates that development plans in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam acknowledge the necessity of viewing social policy as an integral part of holistic development strategies. Barriers to social development include a gap between policy and program implementation, resource constraints, a lack of social planning skills on the part of policy-makers, the centralization of the planning process, the inability of planners to represent the needs of the poor, and the low priority given to social services in resource allocation processes. In addition, many of the countries have been unable to take advantage of reliable and accurate information in the development of social strategies and the evaluation of their impact. On the positive side, policy-makers in the Philippines have agreed that there would be considerable value in the creation of an integrated process of social policy formulation which would involve the government, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations. In addition, a regional network for research and information exchanges would facilitate the development of more effective social policy planning.
