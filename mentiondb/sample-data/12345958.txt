Welfare reform hearings begin with focus on out-of-wedlock births.
Congressional representatives across the political spectrum agree that the US welfare system needs to be reformed, but no consensus exists on how to do it. Central to the argument in support of making major changes is the high number of out-of-wedlock births, especially among low-income teens. Looking for ways to discourage such pregnancies and births, some people argue that the welfare system itself promotes the births. Republicans are calling for punitive action to regulate fertility such as cutting off welfare payments to unwed teens who give birth. Opponents counter that little evidence exists demonstrating that welfare change will reduce rates of out-of-wedlock births or unintended pregnancy. Few in Congress, however, have stepped forward to point out that many unplanned pregnancies and out-of-wedlock births could be avoided if poor and low-income women had better access to voluntary family planning and abortion services. In failing to provide such services for poor women, Congress is failing to act as reality demands.
