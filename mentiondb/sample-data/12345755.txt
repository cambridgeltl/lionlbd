STDs and the pill.
During World War II, venereal disease was regarded as a problem for men in uniform. At that time there were only three common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs): syphilis, gonorrhea, and venereal warts, along with crab lice. Today, there are two dozens STDs, and almost all of them are caused by viruses. They include AIDS, herpes, human papilloma virus, and also chlamydia. In explaining the emergence of the new sexual diseases, STOPP Planned Parenthood has suggested in its November 1987 newsletter that " ...because the contraceptive pill lowers the acid level of the vaginal area it may be a contributing factor to the development and transmission of AIDS." The December 1993 issue of Family Planning Perspectives has reported that "women who test positive for HIV virus and who also use the pill are more likely than non-users to have the virus present in their cervical and vaginal secretions and may be more likely to infect their sex partner... The presence of HIV virus in cervical secretions was nearly 12 times as likely among pill users as among non-users." The newsletter further states that infected women who were taking the pill were also more likely to transmit AIDS to a baby they delivered. Researchers should thoroughly investigate if the contraceptive pill has contributed to the emergence of STDs.
