Starting a programme in Sri Lanka.
A survey conducted by the Sri Lanka Family Planning Association (FPA) revealed a significant unmet need for reproduction health education among young people. The FPA presented the survey findings to policy makers and educational leaders at a national seminar. Emerging from this seminar were a pilot project in Sri Lanka schools, a program to train counselors in premarital at regular intervals. These interventions resulted in a substantial increase in the number of young people presenting to FPA clinics. Moreover, their success led the FPA to launch a national sexual education program in the schools, beginning in 1992. In preparation, a series of orientation seminars were held for Ministry of Education officials and school administrators. A team of teachers was recruited to participate in an intensive 2-month training program in sex education for youth over 15 years of age. At present, daily sex education classes are conducted in selected Sri Lankan schools and out-of-school youth are reached during holidays. The FPA has set a goal of reaching 100,000 young people with this program by the end of 1993. Program evaluation indicates that the proportion of young people who scored over 75% on a test of knowledge of human sexuality increased overall from 9% at pre-test to 67% at post-intervention testing. The FPA has received favorable feedback on this program from parents, educators, community leaders, and religious leaders, including some Buddhist priests.
