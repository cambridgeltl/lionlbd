UNFPA supports safe motherhood.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is supporting a range of safe motherhood activities around the world. Together with the government of Iran, the agency sponsored a regional conference on family planning in Teheran in September 1993. The conference included sessions on the delivery and quality of care in maternal and child health programs, on birth spacing, and on the reproductive health of women. Representatives came from countries as far apart as China and Turkey, including the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. A southern Asian conference on safe motherhood was also partially funded by UNFPA in Chandigarh, India. In Bhutan, UNFPA is supporting a project to cut maternal mortality through a better system of referral of high-risk pregnancies. In Mongolia, the agency has initiated a 4-year project to help cut maternal mortality by half. The project includes increasing knowledge of complications and referral during pregnancy and delivery. Mongolia has started publishing a quarterly Safe Motherhood newsletter in English with support from UNFPA. The first issue includes features on the problems of maternity waiting homes in a period of economic transition and on maternal mortality and fertility in Mongolia. The country's maternal mortality rate among women who give birth at home is 352/100,000 live births, while for those who deliver in hospital the rate is 17/100,000 live births.
