[Dynamics of numerical changes in human population in terms of animal population ecology].
The author uses data concerning the natural regulation of population size and growth among animals to consider possible future scenarios for human population growth. Four possible variants are considered: "numerical stabilization and its consequences connected with density effect; sharp slump caused by a global ecological catastrophe; limited slump brought about by exhaustion of resources and environmental pollution; numerical decrease through birth regulation. It has been shown that only the last variant can, in [the] case of the human population being 1.2-1.5 billion people, ensure restoration of [the] biosphere with keeping [the] existing tempo of scientific-technological progress."
