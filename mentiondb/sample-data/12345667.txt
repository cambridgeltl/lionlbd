Teachers and health workers in two regions of Tanzania were trained in school-based HIV education targeted to students of age approximately 14 years. Educators in the "Ngao" program received two-three days of training in HIV, STDs, and related issues, and practiced participatory teaching methods and how to select and train pupils to lead classroom discussions. They then organized about twenty education sessions over several months using flip charts, chalk boards, posters, and pamphlets, as well as a booklet for the students. Information about condoms, however, was included only as an option in accordance with Ministry of Education and Culture policy. Community elders, religious leaders, and parents were invited to participate in discussions about the program and how the community could take action against AIDS. Findings based upon the program in 6 of 18 schools in urban and rural settings show students having taken part in Ngao to have had more discussions about HIV/AIDS than those from the comparison schools, to have greater knowledge and more positive attitudes about people with AIDS, to be less intent on being sexually active in the near future. The teachers and health workers enjoyed teaching the program. The program has now been revised for continued use among primary school students, with an expanded version being tested for integration into the secondary school general health curriculum.
