Taking a second look at the role of IEC in population programmes: some lessons learned.
Despite considerable investment and support for IEC activities over the past 20-25 years, apparent successes in IEC have not tended to create long-lasting impact upon population programs and have not been sustained over time as expected. The following two key factors contribute toward this state of affairs: inadequate collaboration in IEC planning, management, monitoring, and evaluation; and lack of quality in training, materials development, and materials production. The following lessons have been learned by countries after more than two decades of carrying out IEC activities: the effectiveness of IEC is commensurate to the level of effective leadership and political interest in government; all major IEC initiatives must be carried out directly supporting MCH/FP activities and services at the provincial, district, and village levels; the implementation of activities common to all IEC projects in a country must be properly synchronized and harmonized; IEC activities must reach the village level; and IEC activities should be linked with development programs to make them self-sustaining over the long term.
