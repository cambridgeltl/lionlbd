Condom failure and fornication.
Some argue that using condoms is religiously unacceptable. Arrow, a non-profit nongovernmental organization in Guam dealing with AIDS issues, however, directly opposes this view. There is no risk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse without condoms between sex partners who have been mutually monogamous for at least the past ten years, who have not shared unsterilized injectable drug paraphernalia with others, and who have not had a blood transfusion before 1987. Sexual intercourse without a condom under other circumstances may hold the risk of infecting or being infected with HIV. Many sexually active people lead healthy, fruitful lives in which they have sex with multiple partners and outside of the bounds of marriage. People who argue against condom use on religious or moral grounds are uninformed, ignorant, and simply wrong. Correct and consistent condom use can prevent the transmission of HIV and save lives. Even though they may occasionally fail, condoms tend to be reliable and effective in preventing the transmission of many sexually transmitted diseases.
