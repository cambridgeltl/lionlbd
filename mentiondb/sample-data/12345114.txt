[Integrating types of households and families].
The author outlines a household classification system that takes demographic, social, and economic criteria into account. He "also deals with a question of methodological character, namely how processing the personal and housing data of population censuses in the function of types of households would provide information which can be utilized better than before. Applying this method would also make data processing more economical, since the system mentioned above integrates the types of households and families...[so] that the latter appear...separately from non-family...households."
