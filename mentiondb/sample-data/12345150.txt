Vasectomy and prostate cancer. Expert panel recommends no change in clinical practice.
In March 1992, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a conference on prostate cancer and vasectomy after 2 published studies found an increased risk of prostate cancer in men who had undergone vasectomy, particularly those who had had the vasectomy at least 20 years earlier. Urologists, contraceptive researchers, oncologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, and health policy specialists attended this conference during which 16 researchers presented papers on prostate cancer and vasectomy. Based on these papers and other currently available data, an NIH expert committee concluded that the data are inconsistent and that no convincing biologic mechanism exists explaining an association between prostate cancer and vasectomy, so the committee recommended that clinicians continue to perform vasectomies, after obtaining informed consent. Results of 4 unpublished studies presented at the conference were reassuring. After the 2 studies went public, the Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern Arizona noted a drop from 30-35%/month to 16 vasectomies/month. Its manager of surgical and counseling services found it interesting that men are frightened about the slight risk of prostate cancer while women have always factored risk in their contraceptive decision making. In Warren, Michigan, the news did not change vasectomy numbers, however. Family planning counselors do not agree on whether to include this possible risk into their counseling sessions. NIH calls for more studies to look at the possible association between vasectomy and prostate cancer.
