STDs infect 250 million a year.
Some 250 million cases of sexually transmitted disease (STD) occur each year, and in some countries 1 or even 2 women in every 10 are infected with an STD. STDs are likely to reach an advanced stage before women notice them. The consequences of STDs are devastating, according to a report by the Population Information Program of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and they include stillbirths, blinding eye infections in the newborn, chronic female abdominal pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. There are social consequences for women such as divorce, and husbands may abandon infertile wives. Gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause both severe inflammation of the pelvis with acute pain and possible infertility. Pelvic inflammatory disease can permanently scar the fallopian tubes, increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy, which can be fatal when the fallopian tube ruptures. Babies born to mothers with gonorrhea and chlamydia are likely to develop eye infections that may make them blind. Chlamydia infection in pregnant women may also cause premature rupture of the membranes, sepsis, and the death of premature neonate. Infection may spread to the lungs of newborns, leading to chlamydial pneumonia. Syphilis can cause spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital syphilis in the infant. Trichomoniasis and herpes can also be transmitted from mother to fetus. And infection with an STD increases the risk of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that prenatal care should always include checks for STDs. A WHO Technical Working Group on Care of Mother and Baby has stressed the importance of detecting and treating STDs in pregnant women. The working group urged training of health workers to distinguish between STDs and other infections. The group, which met July 5-9, 1993, outlined health center strategies for prevention and treatment.
