Country watch: the Philippines.
The bold, rational approach to condom use brought by Dr. Juan Flavier, Secretary of the Department of Health (DOH), to the Philippines has dramatically increased awareness about AIDS as well as the levels of condom promotion and acceptance. Dr. Flavier became Secretary of the Department in July 1992. Since then, the attention to AIDS-related issues in the Filipino media has dramatically increased. With the moral and tangible support of the President and the Cabinet, and against the platitudes of religious leaders and some senators, Dr. Flavier created media hype over condoms which led to an increase in AIDS awareness from 12% to 86% in little over 1 year. The Secretary is so popular that he received more than 200 speaking invitations/month. December was proclaimed National AIDS Awareness month in 1992 by the DOH and includes special AIDS education and condom distribution activities. An AIDS hotline is operational in Manila; condoms are now openly advertised in the media; and an express door-to-door delivery service has even been launched by a condom distributor. The decision of a 23-year old woman living with AIDS to go public has also helped DOH efforts. Finally, city ordinances in some areas require hotels and motels to provide customers with condoms or make them accessible, and condoms have become part of the standard equipment of the Philippine Armed Forces.
