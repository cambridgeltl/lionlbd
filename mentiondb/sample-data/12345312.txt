Raising sons as an African feminist.
A Southern African feminist recounts how one morning her son objected to her blouse. She calmly informed him that just as he has the right to choose his outfits so does she. Since then he has not commented on her choice of clothes, but has made comments on how she dances, does her hair, and the length of her skirts/dresses. He has already taken on the male behavior of forging women's identity by remarking on their looks. She insists on a democratic relationship with her son which includes letting him makes choices (e.g., what he eats; she does intervene to an extent to ensure he has a balanced diet, however) to help him develop his own identity. She understands the dominant role mothers play in socializing their children. Her son no longer calls her mummy but by her first name. She now sees that mummy implies dependency. Further, he has asked her to call him by a different name, thereby defining his identity. She takes the time to explain the insensitivity of some sexist statements he sometimes makes to help him become more sensitive. Some of her male colleagues object to her doing this because, in their opinion, it will only make him become more sexist in adulthood. She finds this attitude to be typically arrogant and patriarchal. Specifically, men believe in the definitiveness of male control and its undisputability over time, as though nothing can change maleness as presently defined. In effect they are saying that males cannot be resocialized to be respectful and democratic, thus the struggle for gender equity has no purpose. Men who parent must accept the need to democratize relationships with their children to more fully experience parenting. Women who want to enjoy motherhood more completely should find the challenge of democratizing parent-child relationships to bring about gender sensitivity which is worth the commitment.
