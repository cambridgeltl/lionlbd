Taking leadership initiatives.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has previously stressed that solving population problems is crucial to the goal of sustainable development and will require a broad-based approach. Matching rhetoric with funds, Hosokawa recently announced that the Japanese government will increase its official development assistance to developing countries in the field of population and AIDS to approximately US 3 billion from 1994 to the year 2000. This average outlay of US 428 million per year is more than five times larger than the present level of assistance. He also announced that Japan would sponsor a Meeting of Eminent Persons on Population and Development January 1994. It is hoped that the declaration produced from this meeting will help guide the development of the declaration from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo. It is also noted that the new prime minister, Tsutomu Hata, will carry on Japan's extended role in population and AIDS assistance in the absence of Hosokawa.
