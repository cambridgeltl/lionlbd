[On mortality in the Czech Republic].
"In this article, Czech mortality rates are inspected in a new perspective...the levels of mortality constructed in Coale's and Demeny's Regional Model Life Tables and in Coale's and Guang Guo's revised edition of the life tables. Czech male and female life expectancies are also contrasted with hypothetical ones computed by means of Coale's equation which sets a 'standard' pattern of life expectancy development in low mortality societies." The impact of past political and social systems is also considered. (SUMMARY IN ENG AND RUS)
