Invisible man: can global efforts raise a new generation of men who take family planning seriously?
In Bogota, Columbia, one of Profamilia's 8 male-only family planning (FP) clinics, which provide vasectomies and counsel men on topics such as how to avoid sexually transmitted diseases and how to cope with the needs of their families, can barely satisfy the demand for condoms. Providers explain this phenomenon in a country where the contraceptive prevalence rate for condoms is very low by suggesting that the men simply had to be asked to try condoms. Men not only have to be asked, however, they have to be asked in the right way. With resources for women still scarce, many FP personnel believe that it would be a waste of time to focus efforts on men. Others point out that FP clinics are female-centered are and suggest that men must be viewed as a very important part of any effort to prevent unwanted pregnancies. With the presence of AIDS in the heterosexual community, male contraception has moved from being desirable to being essential. Also, through the worldwide focus on women's status worldwide, many women are feeling empowered to demand an increased male role in contraception. The Chinese no-scalpel technique for vasectomy has spread throughout much of the world, and 42 million couples rely on vasectomy. However, in many developing countries, most men insist on achieving their desired family size and typically have more children than women. Despite this interest in producing babies, men rarely participate in child care activities. Through a variety of new male-targeted programs in the US and in developing countries, new techniques to involve men in FP responsibilities will be developed and disseminated. In the meantime, women will get center-stage at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, and men will continue to receive condoms in Bogota.
