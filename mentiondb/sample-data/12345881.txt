What is needed to ensure the health and survival of mother and baby?
All pregnant women are at risk of developing life-threatening complications during pregnancy or childbirth. The majority of maternal deaths, however, are the result of complications such as hemorrhage, puerperal sepsis, hypertension, obstructed labor, and abortion which can be readily treated at an hospital or health center equipped to provide essential obstetric functions such as cesarean section, blood replacement, and medical treatment. Such maternal mortality can be successfully prevented without sophisticated technology. Even health centers with neither operative facilities nor all of the essential obstetric functions can provide first aid and stabilize patients by starting antibiotic treatment and rehydration before referral to an higher level of care. In so doing, women reach the referral hospital in better condition and improve their chances of survival. Linking health centers and referral hospitals is the key to maternal survival. The Safe Motherhood program is developing guides aimed at midwives, nurses, and non-specialist doctors at the first contact level and the first referral level designed to help health care providers cope with obstetric emergencies and prevent complications from becoming emergencies. Topics include planning of obstetric emergencies; the prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, severe anemia, prolonged labor, and ruptured uterus; use of the partograph to prevent prolonged or obstructed labor; the treatment of incomplete or inevitable abortion; the essentials of prenatal care; the identification of pre-eclampsia; and how to take blood pressure and maintain a sphygmomanometer.
