Bhutan. Training forms master trainers for second cycle project.
A Masters Trainers Training Program has been undertaken as part of the project, BHU/90/P01 (Population Education for Schools and Communities), which began in 1990, in order to prepare for the second part of the project (1993-1996) during which 600 school teachers will be trained. Upgrading the competence and skills of teachers in teaching population education is required for the successful implementation of the project. A pool of master trainers will be selected from participants, who include lecturers from Teachers Training College, Paro and National Institute of Education, Samtse, the District Education Officers, Curriculum Officers, CTDD, and the school inspectors. The training sessions covered theory and practice; the course content focused on population growth, environment, ecosystem, agricultural productions, family life education, health and teaching methodologies, and curriculum development.
