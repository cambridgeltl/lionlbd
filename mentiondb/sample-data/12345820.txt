WHO partograph cuts complications of labour and childbirth.
Use of the partograph during labor can prevent suffering and loss of life. The partograph records the progress of labor, especially the rate of cervical dilatation. WHO's partograph differentiates between the latent phase of labor (slow dilatation up to 2 cm) and the active phase, during which the cervix dilates by at least 1 cm/hour to full dilatation. The partograph can detect abnormal progression of labor. Then clinicians can either augment labor by administering oxytocin or, in extreme cases of prolonged or obstructed labor, perform a cesarean section. Use of the WHO partograph in 8 hospitals in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia reduced postpartum infections (by 59%), the number of stillbirths, the amount of oxytocin augmentation, and unnecessary cesarean sections. Thus, the WHO partograph was able to differentiate labors requiring intervention from those not requiring intervention. WHO calls for health personnel to use its partograph and its management protocol, both in labor wards with the capabilities to manage labor complications and in health centers without these capabilities which can refer women with labor complications to a specialist facility.
