Pope's concerns are not just empty rhetoric.
Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II has said that the future of the family and of society itself is at stake at a time when the institution of the family is more important than ever. The crisis in Western civilization is plain every day in news stories of violence and is not surprising in the US which has a President and congressmen who vote to allow the killing of unborn babies. The American liberal endorsement of the package of activities forwarded by the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) will result in the use of US tax dollars to promote sexual promiscuity, contraception, and abortion in less developed countries. All of this activity is based on the liberal conviction that God does not care about methods of birth control. This neo-Malthusian doctrine was adopted by the Church of England in 1930, and liberal American Protestantism quickly followed suit. This doctrine, now embraced by liberal Catholics as well, is directly responsible for the social evils we are suffering from today. With sex no longer confined to marriage, homosexual behavior is no longer condemned. The ICPD largely ignored the institution of marriage, mentioning the word only once in the draft document's chapter on the family. Sex has been divorced from marriage, and the family has been divorced from marriage. This will affect the future of humankind.
