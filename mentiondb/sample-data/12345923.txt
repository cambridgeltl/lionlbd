CHILD - to - child: the programme in survival and development of children.
This study examined the effectiveness of training programs during October 1986 and September 1987 for elder children who reared younger siblings in rural villages in India. The study population came from Bariasanpur, Rustampur, and Khanpur for the experimental group and from Narayanpur, Kodopur, and Ledhupur for the matched control group. Baseline information and interviews were collected for 280 families and 1745 persons: 136 experimental group families and 144 control group families. 46 children in the experimental group and 30 children in the control group were selected for the training sessions. Training was conducted over a four-day period for groups of 15 children. Pictures were used for illiterates to depict illness and treatment. Topics included injury, fever, diarrhea, and food hygiene. Assessment was made after seven days using an instrument and scales developed by Guilbert and methods suggested by Siegel. 48.57% of families used a child-to-child system of care at some point. 70.54% or 86 families in areas where training was available agreed to have their elder children trained. Child care by elder children involved about 26 days per month. Only 3-6% of the families had toys for children. Younger children were fed about three times a day in either group. There were significant differences in knowledge between the control and experimental groups. Skills were also improved in the experimental group. 53.6% of families were lower caste, and 44.3% were middle caste. The mean per capital income was Rs. 77.90 +or- 31.33. 97 of 144 families involved maternal caretakers. Good quality of care was provided by 75% of mothers on food hygiene, 82.1% on diarrhea, 50% on fever, and 64.3% on accidents. 10.7% of grandparents provided good quality care.
