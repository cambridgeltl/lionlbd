Europe without internal frontiers and international migration.
"This paper documents the process by which the freedom of movement of workers has been established in the European Community and uses data on migrant flows and stocks to assess whether such freedom of movement has had a significant effect in increasing intra-Community migration. Although the evidence suggests that the presence of Community workers increased in newly admitted Community member States, such as the United Kingdom during the 1970s and, more recently, Greece, Portugal and Spain, the numbers involved are small in relative terms. In contrast, the enactment of freedom of movement provisions has not contributed to a noticeable increase in the outflow of workers from the poorer to the richer member States."
