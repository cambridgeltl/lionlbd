Socio-economic and urbanization profiles of internal migration in Egypt: a canonical correlation analysis.
"Data on in- and out-migration in Egypt by governorate and on variables believed to interact with migration are examined. The purpose is to identify the dimensions through which the basic demographic phenomenon can be rationally structured. This objective is approached through a general multivariate analysis technique known as canonical correlation analysis....A number of variables believed to act as determinants of migration are used and arbitrarily classified into four groups to represent four distinct migration profiles, namely, sociodemographic, economic, urbanization, and health profiles.... The analysis shows that the economic profile of migration is the most pronounced one of the four profiles examined."
