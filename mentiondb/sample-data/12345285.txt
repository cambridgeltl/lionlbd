CEDPA Africa Office honors Kenya M.P. Phoebe Asiyo, WIM 1.
The discussion highlights the accomplishments of Phoebe Asiyo, who was an alumna of the first Women in Management (WIM) workshops of CEDPA Africa and a Member of Parliament from Western Kenya. Phoebe Asiyo was honored by over 100 guests at a CEDPA Africa Regional Office reception in Nairobi. CEDPA's president remarked that the Honorable Mrs. Asiyo had worked very hard on women's issues in her lifetime with enthusiasm, fresh ideas, and challenges to continue working with and for women. Mrs. Asiyo was elected to Parliament in 1992 as one of six other women after involvement in the Kenya campaign for democracy. Since independence, the number of women legislators has been the highest. Her legislative efforts were encouraged and sustained by involvement in the 1978 WIM workshop, after which she was elected to Parliament (1980). Between 1980 and 1988, there were only two women members: (Mrs. Asiyo and another). Between 1988 and 1992, Mrs. Asiyo served as ambassador to UNIFEM, the UN Development Fund for Women. Mrs. Asiyo considers that women's contribution to political life has been to provide the kind of leadership that empowers and enables the poor and grassroots communities to take control of their lives and their communities. Leaders in power are held accountable for their impact on an impoverished population, with new standards initiated by women. This type of leadership leads to long-term betterment in living conditions.
