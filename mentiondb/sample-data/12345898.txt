Abortion and pregnant adolescents.
More than one million teenage girls become pregnant annually and 31,000 are younger than 15 years old. 400,000 of these annual pregnancies in the US are aborted. These high rates of adolescent pregnancy and abortion have failed to significantly decline despite school curricula which instruct students in sex education and birth control. Adolescents often need counseling to evaluate the possible outcomes which may be associated with their behaviors. Abortion, in particular, can awaken strong emotions in those who undergo the procedure. Previewing, an interpersonal technique derived from caregiver-infant interactions, is a strategy which may be effective in counseling adolescents who are undergoing abortions. The process involves a caregiver representing through imagery a developmental skill the prospective infant is likely to achieve in the near future such as crawling. An enactment exercise is then devised during which the new skill may be practiced with the potential infant. The sequelae of previewing include an enhanced ability to predict and respond to upcoming developmental changes as well as changes in the interpersonal relationship between mother and infant. Previewing techniques may be used analogously with adolescents confronting abortion to help them represent alternatives for handling the pregnancy, predict the most beneficial alternatives, envision and work through negative emotions, and devise more adaptive behaviors to be enacted in the future so that pregnancy becomes a planned event rather than an accident. Three case studies, each focusing upon a different phase of the teenager's cognitive and emotional development, are presented in addition to the general discussion of the previewing approach.
