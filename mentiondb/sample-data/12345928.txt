Federal anti-violence law used to respond to anti-choice threats.
On January 6, 1995, a temporary restraining order was filed in US District Court in Missouri against an anti-abortion activist who "has engaged in an escalating practice of threats and physical acts to intimidate and interfere with employees and patients of Planned Parenthood clinics." The activist was restrained from approaching within 500 feet of a women's health clinic that provides abortions and to cease making threats against clinic staff and patients. A January 17th date was set for a hearing on a preliminary injunction pending the outcome of a civil action against the activist. Also on January 6th, attorneys for the Justice Department in Ohio filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against an anti-abortion activist who allegedly threatened the lives of a physician who performs abortions and of his wife, a nurse. This suit is the first filed by the Justice Department based on the new Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE).
