The Tokyo Declaration: toward a global partnership in population and development.
Population is a global issue which greatly affects the social, economic, and cultural development of all nations. Since population factors play a decisive role in all human endeavors, especially in safeguarding the environment and pursuing sustainable development, they are of vital concern to both developed and developing countries. More is known now than ever before about what is needed to slow population growth, alleviate poverty, enhance women's status, combat gender inequalities, abolish illiteracy, and reduce infant, child, and maternal mortality. A strong political commitment and the mobilization of popular support for effective action are called for. Almost all developing countries have national population policies and programs aimed at integrating population into development strategies and meeting the rapidly increasing demand for family planning information and services. Participants of the Meeting of Eminent Persons on Population and Development in Tokyo, Japan, January 26-27, 1994, issued a declaration under the auspices of the UN Population Fund, the United Nations University, and the Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The text of the declaration is presented in sections on population and sustainable development, women's role in decision making, reproductive health and family planning, population distribution and migration, South-South cooperation, from commitment to action, the 1994 International Conference of Population and Development, resource mobilization, and a call to action.
