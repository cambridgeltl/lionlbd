The level and mechanism of China's urbanization.
Data from the 10% sample of China's Census of Population in 1990 were used to examine levels and interprovincial differences in urbanization. The household registration system and registration based on actual place of residence were used to examine trends. Urban population was 26.24% of total population in 1990. Six levels of urbanization were identified: 1) rates over 65% in Beijing (5.57 million), Tianjin (4.58 million), and Shanghai (7.50 million); 2) northeastern region with 3 provinces with rates over 40%: Shenjang city (3.8 million); 3) urbanization over 30% in Guangdong, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Zhejiang; 4) urbanization rates over 25% in Hubei, Ningxia, Shandong, Shanxi, and Qinghai; 5) rates between 20% and 25% in Fujian, Jangsu, Gansu, Sha'anxi, Hainan, and Guizhou; and 6) urbanization below 20% in Sichuan, Tibet, Hebei, Anhui, Hunan, Guangxi, Henan, and Yunnan. The relationship between urbanization (U) and average gross national product (GNP) was expressed as U = 0.01347 GNP + 7.43. The relationship was linear for those with high levels of urbanization. High urban growth provinces were Guangdong, Hubei, Shandong, and Tibet. Slow growth was evident in Henan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Sha'anxi. The urbanization process was described as subject to discrepancies due to administrative readjustment. Some rural population became urban population without actual migration: 23.4523 million of which 5.9861 million changed to city residents and 17.4662 to town residents. 1.2452 actually migrated from rural areas to cities and 4.741 were nonmigrating. Town populations were estimated as 15.4751 million transformed and 1.9911 million who actually migrated to towns. Total urban population between 1985-90 was 35.6688 million people, of which 56.7% were transformed and 43.3% migrated from rural to urban areas. 16.5707 million people became urban residents, of which 71.4% were actual migrants, whereas 81.0% of town population of 19.0981 million were administrative changes without migration. 66.1% of the 11.8297 million migrants crossed city/county lines, 23.4% moved between provinces, and 10.5% moved within city/county boundaries.
