Expanded role for OCs. Question and answer.
Combined oral contraceptives (OCs), especially the current low-dose formulations, provide significant noncontraceptive benefits. They bring about an overall improvement in health. Some physicians are interested in prescribing OCs to premenopausal women at an early age, even if they are not at risk for unwanted pregnancy, to protect these women from developing 2 fatal cancers. Even though this is not currently the standard of care, much data provide justification to seriously consider prescribing OCs to premenopausal women. Ever use of OCs reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by 40-80% and the risk of endometrial cancer by 40-60%. Ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer are the 4th and 7th leading causes of death among US women, respectively. The protective effect against both cancers is associated with duration of OC use and continues for many years after OC use ceases. OC use also reduces the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), from which about 1 million US women suffer each year. It decreases the incidence of hospitalization for PID by about 50%. OC use also protects against functional ovarian cysts, iron deficiency anemia, and benign breast disease. It appears that use of OCs for at least 6 years increases bone density and thus reduces the risk of hip fractures in later life. OC use may also protect against disabling rheumatoid arthritis. On the other hand, there is some evidence that OCs may be associated with breast cancer, but the epidemiologic data are inconsistent. A thorough analysis of the risk-benefit ratio using available data should be conducted to weigh the noncontraceptive benefits of early or long-term OC use with the risks.
