Native wage impacts of foreign labor: a random effects panel analysis.
"In this paper, we explore the...issue of how wages are affected [by foreign labor] using a vast panel data set for West Germany.... The paper provides evidence that foreigners affect the wages of low-qualified and high-qualified Germans. While relatively small gains are made by white collar employees with less than 20 years experience, these are outweighed by the larger wage reductions experienced by blue collar employees."
