The changing geography of mortality in Norway, 1969-1989.
"Changes in the geographical mortality pattern for Norway between 1969 and 1989 are explored for total mortality, coronary heart disease, stomach cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, infant mortality and suicide. The period has shown considerable flux. Coronary heart disease mortality used to be higher in urban than rural areas, but the situation has now reversed (for men) or equalized (for women). The excess infant mortality in the periphery has been eliminated. Suicide has increased faster in fishing and farming areas than in the cities. The changes are interpreted through some concepts and models: the epidemiological transition, geographical and social diffusion, regional restructuring, changes of the physical environment and geographical uniqueness." Data are from official sources.
