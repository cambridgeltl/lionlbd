[Labor migration in a unified Germany].
"In this paper we illustrated future migration of labor within the old and new 'Lander' of unified Germany.... Our setting was a microbased general equilibrium model. It was shown that the diverging economic conditions within reunified Germany heavily distort the choice of location of German workers. If the transfer of capital and technology does not equalize the large discrepancies rapidly, net migration of eastern workers into the west of close to 12 percent of the eastern work force by 1993, and 16 percent by 1995, is to be expected."
