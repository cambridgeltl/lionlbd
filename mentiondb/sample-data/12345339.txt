Achieving population dispersal through tailor-made community planning: an Israeli experiment in the Galilee region.
The author describes a program designed to encourage population dispersal that was carried out in the central Galilee region of Israel during the 1980s. The program involved setting up 52 small communities with the appropriate infrastructures to attract young, well-educated settlers. "The plan succeeded in attracting the desired type of population...to the region, and the newcomers viewed the new communities as their permanent homes. Based on this experience and on the analysis of relevant literature, a development strategy of tailor-made community planning is hereby recommended for future projects. It is especially appropriate in the context of developed countries with a slow to zero population growth and with spreading social norms of the postindustrial society."
