[Diversity of couple relationships].
"This article focuses on differences between married women who cohabited prior to marriage, married women who did not cohabit prior to marriage, and cohabiting women. There are quite remarkable differences between these three groups: in opinions about primary relationships and separations, in motives for marrying, in behaviour (stability of union, labour force participation) and individual and couple-related characteristics (number of children, religion). These results come from the Netherlands Family and Fertility Survey 1993 conducted by Statistics Netherlands." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
