Country watch: Zimbabwe.
AIDS in Zimbabwe is widely viewed as a problem of others despite widespread knowledge about the basic facts of AIDS. The National AIDS Coordination Program and UNICEF have therefore collaborated to produce and disseminate a special video for an about Zimbabweans to counter this dangerous attitude. The 35-minute English video "No need to blame" presents 3 Zimbabwean women and 2 Zimbabwean men, all healthy-looking, who describe how they feel about their HIV-seropositive status, family reactions, and their hopes and fears. Family members also share their experiences regarding support, care, and future prospects. The film focuses upon themes of responsible behavior, care, compassion, and the destigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS. It is hoped that the video will help viewers realize that AIDS is a problem for a growing number of people who are not very dissimilar from themselves. The video was first pretested over 10 sessions in June, 1993 with schoolchildren, out-of-school youths, religious leaders, Ministry of Health and Information officers, and youth organization representatives; reactions were generally encouraging. Only minor changes were subsequently made, a discussion guide was included, and feedback forms will be completed based upon audience discussions after each screening.
