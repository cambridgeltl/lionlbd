Changes in China's fertility rate in the 1980s and an analysis of the related social and economic factors.
In the 1980s, the government reform policy exerted a profound impact on Chinese society and the economy, including the fertility rate. A sample survey of two thousandths of the total population was conducted in mid-1988. Social and economic factors were investigated primarily using the total fertility rate (TFR). The new Marriage Act was adopted in 1988 setting marriage age at 20; previously, early marriage and childbearing before age 18 had occurred often. Early marriage had declined from 47.89% in 1970 to 12.53% in 1979. In rural areas more than half of marriages were early marriages, dropping to 16.90% by 1979 and increasing to 25% in 1987. Consequently, the cumulative fertility rate in the 15-20 age group rose 88% from 1980 to 1988. Mature-age marriage, at age 23 or older, became more common both in urban and rural areas, with a 80.0% and 42.26% rate, respectively, in 1979. However, by 1987 it declined to 66.84% and 20.71%, respectively. The age at first childbearing had grown to 24.45 in 1980 (23.89 in rural areas); however, it was reversed to 23.04 in 1987 (22.56 in rural areas). The cumulative fertility in the 15-24 age group shot up between 1980 and 1987. THe cumulative fertility rate in terms of TFR in this group grew from 35.21% in 1980 to 47.74% in 1987. Single-child cumulative fertility rates in the age groups of 15-19 and 20-24 had declined to below 1 in the late 1970s and 1980, but these were merely postponed childbearing. In 1987 many rural women began to have their second child. Multiple births in rural areas declined from 59.80% in 1970 to 20.86% in 1987, while total number of births increased 41.78% in 1987. In urban areas the TFR was 1.98 after 1974 and declined to 1.24 in 1980 and then rose to 1.36, a little below the planned TFR of 1.25. In rural areas, low per capita income and its irrational distribution favor less educated people, while transformation into the household-based economy requires child labor, factors which have impeded the family planning program.
