Nepal launches new projects.
The CEDPA Nepal Country Office (NCO), directed by Mana Rana (WIM 5 and S_E 13), has launched an expanded leadership training program for women's NGOs and new service delivery projects under a 5-year grant extension from USAID. With additional support from the UNFPA, the NCO will undertake a new project with the Mothers' Club, a national women's NGO. The project will mobilize women and women's organizations to address grassroots needs. The CEDPA ACCESS Project recently funded the Nepal Red Cross and Family Planning Association of Nepal to begin community-based family planning projects. Trained volunteers will distribute nonclinical contraceptives from their homes, provide services through home visits, and refer clients to clinics. Nancy Russell, a nonprofit manager with 20 years of experience, has been appointed CEDPA resident coordinator for Nepal.
