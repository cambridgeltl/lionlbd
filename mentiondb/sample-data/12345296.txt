[Geo-linguistic mobility of the Francophone population of Quebec and Ontario].
"The relation between geographic and linguistic mobility among the population of French mother tongue in Ontario and Quebec [Canada] is explored. The results show that language behaviour, in particular the use of English as home language, is fairly regularly and coherently related to spatial behaviour. A distinct positive correlation between geographic and linguistic mobility is observed. It would seem, furthermore, that the ability of various linguistic environments to impose the dominant language is notably stronger when the dominant language is English." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
