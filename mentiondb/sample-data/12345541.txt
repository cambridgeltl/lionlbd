Chile averts measles outbreak.
Chile is the first mainland country in Latin America to have arrested epidemic transmission of measles virus for more than 18 months. The health ministry successfully averted an imminent outbreak of the measles virus. Health personnel knew that the 2- to 3-year epidemic periodicity of measles meant that an outbreak could be expected in 1992. Although coverage levels had hovered around 90% since the last epidemic, an outbreak could occur among those who had not been vaccinated in that period or those who failed to seroconvert. To prevent an outbreak, health authorities decided to organize a National Campaign that would vaccinate 95% of all children aged 9 months to 14 years old (3,930,000 children) in 2 weeks. 99.6% of the children were immunized with a standard dose, regardless of their previous vaccination history. Post-campaign epidemiologic surveillance of rash and fever illness was carried out from April 17, 1992 with the organization of laboratory diagnostic capabilities. Compliance with the probable measles case definition nearly doubled between 1992 and 1993, and the proportion of probable measles cases for which blood samples were taken increased from 64% to 79% for the same period. Compatible cases declined from 8% to 5% between 1992 and 1993. From the time the campaign was organized to the end of 1993, only 2 imported cases of measles were confirmed. Chile's experience offers several useful hints for other countries, particularly setting up a system for the active surveillance of rash and fever illness. The measles surveillance case definition must be disseminated and the critical clinical information for each case must be reported. Priority should also be given to ensuring that adequate blood samples are taken before a case is discarded. The final diagnosis for a large percentage of probable cases was determined by laboratory analysis. Surveillance means vaccinating all susceptibles as soon as a probable case is reported.
