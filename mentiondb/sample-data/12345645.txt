Evolution of the response to AIDS in Thailand.
The first case of AIDS was reported in Thailand in 1984, precipitating the cumulative total of 5990 cases reported in 1994; 3959 of these cases were detected in 1993. More than 600,000 people are estimated to be infected with HIV in the country, yet asymptomatic. Heterosexual intercourse is the most common mode of HIV transmission. At first, the Thai government denied that AIDS was a serious problem. It has since, however, implemented one of the most aggressive, comprehensive HIV/AIDS control programs in the world. The government provided basic public education through some government STD clinics over the period 1983-87 with focus upon determining and tracking the extent to which HIV and AIDS had pervaded society. People perceived to be at high risk of infection were warned, reported AIDS cases were investigated by the Ministry of Health, and serosurveillance was established among groups of people whose behavior put them at high risk of acquiring HIV. An AIDS committee was established in 1985 leading to the approval and launching of an AIDS prevention and control plan over the period 1987-91 of HIV serosurveillance among many target groups, AIDS education activities for the public, and health personnel training to be carried out independently by different units of the government located mostly within the health sector. Operations were centralized under the Center for Prevention and Control of AIDS established in October 1987, blood donations were universally tested, and the overall government budget for AIDS increased from US 200,000 in 1988 to  45 million in 1993 spread among ministries beyond that responsible for public health. AIDS prevention policies are described on condom availability, medical care and counseling, and confidentiality and antidiscrimination, as well as lessons learned and major achievements.
