Sexual health? Do we or don't we?
To focus on sexual health issues represents a major challenge for Family Planning Associations in the decade ahead. Some argue that such a focus will divert family planning programs from their original mission and close off sources of funding. These arguments overlook the impossibility of isolating family planning from sexuality. An exclusive emphasis on contraception leads to the medicalization of the public aspect of sexuality and a dismissal of the intense emotions associated with sexual activity. A medical view of sexuality leads, in turn, to an emphasis on changing individual behaviors and blaming couples involved in unplanned pregnancies. An alternative approach is to help people to take control of and enjoy their sexuality, relationships, and fertility. Moreover, the same laws, institutions, and social values that prevent couples from controlling their fertility (through restrictions on abortion, for example) shape internal and external concepts of sexuality. The provision of contraceptives to adolescents is not sufficient in a social context where girls feed shame if they engage in premarital sex and guilty if they refuse and boys are not encouraged to assume co-responsibility for sexual encounters.
