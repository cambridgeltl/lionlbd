Women and family planning. Introduction.
Family Health International is implementing the Women's Studies Project, a five-year research effort funded by the US Agency for International Development, to learn about women's needs and perspectives on family planning. The project will use qualitative and quantitative research to determine how women have benefitted or not benefitted from using family planning methods and services, with findings to be widely disseminated, including through future issues of Network. This issue of Network focuses upon the family planning aspect of women's reproductive health needs. Women are not just using contraceptive methods, but helping to design and implement family planning services and policies. Moreover, family planning is no longer viewed as an isolated medical service, but as a component of women's larger reproductive health needs which include pregnancy-related care, STD prevention and treatment, prevention and treatment of reproductive cancers, the treatment of infertility, and postpartum and postabortion care. Improving education, economic opportunities, and public policies, while providing access to safe, affordable contraceptive services can improve women's health and status. The futility of encouraging contraceptive use and smaller families without addressing other legal, social, and economic constraints upon women's rights is stressed.
