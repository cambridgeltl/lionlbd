An analytical comparison of fertility rate among women in Beijing with different social and economic characteristics.
In Beijing, the total fertility rate (TFR) fluctuated between 1.3 and 1.8 in the 1980s, and in 1989 it was 1.3. A preliminary survey of 10% of the city's population involved 1,086,000 people, including 299,700 women aged 15-50. Samples of these women were used in group-specific comparisons of fertility rates in 1989. Women in agricultural residence made up 43.2% of the total, whose TFR was 1.822, vs. 0.925 for women in nonagricultural residence. The average childbearing age for agricultural women was 16 years, and their fertility was declining gradually after the age of 28 as opposed to the precipitous after 28 among nonagricultural women. 54% of the agricultural group had 1 child, 48% had 2 children, and 6% had 3 or more children. In contrast, 98% of nonagricultural women had 1 child. Among employed women, 30.7% were in production and transport, 2.6% were farmers, forest workers, and fishers and 20.5% were professional and technical personnel, with the rest being employed in services, post and telecommunications, civil service, and business. The TFR of unemployed women (mostly housewives with a TFR of 3.42) was 2.367, vs. 1.224 for agricultural women. More than 90% of these housewives were agricultural women. A multivariate analysis with the dependent variable of live births to individual women found that, except for age and housewife (or not) status, all variables were negative. In contrast to illiterates, farmers, forest workers, and fisher women, women with higher educational levels and in other occupations had few children. The average number of children born to women with elementary school education was 0.5 less than among illiterates, and 1 less among university graduates than among illiterates. Elementary and junior high school education had the highest marginal impact. The family planning program has been successful in Beijing in lowering fertility, with further declines expected. However, rural women still had more than 1 child at an early age; this phenomenon, as well as raising their educational level, should be the focus of the program.
