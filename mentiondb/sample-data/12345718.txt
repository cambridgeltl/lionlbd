[Changes in the marital status of females giving birth in adolescence, 1983-1993].
"A national survey was carried out in [Hungary in] 1983 covering females who gave birth to their first child [at] the age of 17 years and under. At that time 59 per cent of them were married, 29 per cent cohabited with the child's father, and 12 per cent were single mothers, the pregnancy of which originated from a short-lived relationship. A similar survey was carried out among the same young mothers in 1993. The study shows the changes which took place in their marital status. The proportion of married rose to 81 per cent.... Once ten years were over, 9 per cent of the mothers were divorced, and 1 per cent were widowed. The proportion of single mothers came also to 9 per cent, some half of them---mostly females of gipsy ethnic group--maintained cohabitation permanently with the first child's father. It is a characteristic feature of the sample that cohabitation is more admitted than in the population on the whole." (SUMMARY IN ENG AND RUS)
