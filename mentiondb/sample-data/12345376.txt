Family planning encompasses sexuality -- an Asian perspective.
In India, where there is widespread ignorance about sexuality and a resistance to its open discussion, sexual and reproductive health issues must be integrated into family planning programs. It is not possible for staff to discuss birth spacing with clients without also addressing the sexual context. Sexual problems that are an appropriate focus for family planning programs include difficulty achieving orgasm, pain on intercourse, vaginismus, impotence, premature ejaculation, and loss of libido. An integrated program is especially necessary in Asian countries given women's hesitation to raise sexual issues. Family planning staff have been shaped by the same cultural taboos and must be helped, through training, to adopt an open, positive attitude toward human sexuality. This openness must extend to unmarried young people as well.
