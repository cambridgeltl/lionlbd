People need contraception because they have sex.
Since decisions about contraception are formed in the context of sexual activity, family planning programs are urged to broaden their focus to include sexual health. Sexuality-related needs may include contraception, protection from sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), rape counseling, learning how to achieve satisfying sexual relationships, or overcoming shame and guilt. In this context, family planning personnel need to relinquish their role as experts and become facilitators, helping people to identify and articulate their needs. Also needed is training to enable staff to talk sensitively, comfortably, and respectfully about sex. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has forced family planning programs to talk about the reality of sexual life. Not only must personal life-style issues be discussed, but proper use of condoms must be demonstrated. Operations research is currently underway in 6 Family Planning Associations in developing countries to determine how the concept of sexual health can best be operationalized in work with local communities.
