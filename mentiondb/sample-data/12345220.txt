Sochua Mu Leiper, director of Khemara. Interview.
In Cambodia, Khemara, the first indigenous nongovernmental organization (NGO) working exclusively with women, was formed in 1993. In this interview, its director identifies the particular problems facing women in Cambodia as resulting from the fact that half of the population was decimated during 1975-79, leaving 30% of the female population widows who must support their families alone. In addition, forced migrations during this era eradicated the community support system as well as the family system. Khemara is seeking to help by presenting an integrated approach to income generation, child-care, and literacy development. Khemara will help women relearn how to trust themselves and each other and to accept the responsibility to meet their needs. As an indigenous NGO, Khemara hopes to train Women's Association (local welfare department) staff along with their own staff, and the agency intends to maintain an all-Cambodian staff that understands the culture and the background firsthand. Khemara's first priorities are to train staff in community development and to stress the need of women to organize.
