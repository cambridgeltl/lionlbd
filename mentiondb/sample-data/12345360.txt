Editorial.
Included in this issue (1993, volume 2) of "Planned Parenthood Challenges," a publication of International Planned Parenthood Federation, are articles advocating the integration of family planning, sexuality, and reproductive health. Cited as rationale for such an approach is the fact that decisions on family planning are made in the context of sexuality and reproduction. Contraception is sought out because people want to have sex free of the threat of an unwanted pregnancy. Moreover, people are concerned about preserving their reproductive health capacity. Thus, family planning can be conceptualized as a facilitating process that gives people control over their own sexuality and health. Contributions in this issue discuss the regional and sociocultural aspects of integrated family planning programs, consider challenges for program administrators, and offer concrete examples of programs and activities at the field level. Countered is the notion that sexuality is too sensitive a topic to be addressed directly by family planning programs without undermining their acceptability and stature.
