[The role of family planning units in the prevention of female tumors].
1000 women selected randomly in the Italian provinces of Roma and Latina were given a questionnaire seeking information on age, occupation, oral contraceptive (OC) use, self-examination of the breasts, frequency of visits to clinics and Pap test, parity, and family history of tumors. 98% of the women were familiar with the services offered by family planning (FP) units. 786 questionnaires were analyzed. 80% of the subjects were 35 years old: the 21-25 age group was most prevalent. 40% were employed, the rest were housewives or retired (according to official statistics in 1984 only 25.9% of women were employed). Visits to the gynecologist increased with advancing age but proved to be inadequate for prevention even in the age segment most at risk of acquiring malignant neoplasms (p .05). Women who stayed at home were most likely to have regular gynecological checkups and Pap tests. 24% of women answered in the affirmative about self-examination of the breasts, and the 26-30 age group was most interested in it. 31% of housewives also practiced it, compared to only 10% of those who worked (p .01). OC use was most prevalent in the 26-30 age group (over 30%), while those 35 and under 20 neglected its use. FP units play an important role in oncological prevention by observing cultural and social aspects of women's lives and by adapting preventive programs accordingly.
