Update on vasectomy.
There have been no calls for reversal surgery in the aftermath of studies which point to a connection between vasectomy and increased risk of prostate cancer. Instead, doctors have been advised to continue to perform the procedure while further research takes place. 2 of the studies which identified the risk were published in 1990 in the same journal. In the first, the authors found an "unexpected" association between vasectomy and prostate cancer (a 3.5-5.3 times greater risk for vasectomized men) but postulated that an undetected bias might be the cause. In the second, a case control study of 614 men with prostate cancer revealed a 1.7 times higher overall risk which began 12 years after the surgery and increased to 2.2 times between 13 and 18 years postvasectomy. The third and fourth studies were published in the same journal in 1993. The third report, of a prospective study, followed 10,055 cancer-free vasectomized men and 37,000 similar controls for 4 years and found a 1.6 times greater risk of prostate cancer in vasectomized men which increased with age to a 1.85 times relative risk 22 years after the procedure. The fourth report, a retrospective analysis, investigated 13,124 vasectomized men and 12,392 controls and found an elevated risk of 1.56 after 10 years postvasectomy which increased to 1.89 at 20 years. Vasectomy affects the prostate gland by interrupting the normal flow of fluid from the testes through the prostate gland via the ejaculatory ducts. After vasectomy (and with aging), the prostate itself also secretes less fluid. In addition, vasectomy alters immune function which may, in turn, enhance tumor growth. It is possible that reversal surgery will prove to reduce this risk of prostate cancer.
