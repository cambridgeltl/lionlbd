[Specific radioimmunoassay of pancreatic glucagon. Results in new-born and in child (author's transl)].
Rabbits were immunized with polymerized glucagon and specific antisera obtained. Antiserum used at a dilution of 1/24 000 (final concentration) exhibited a cross reaction of 1,6% with enteroglucagon. Radioimmunoassay of serum glucagon employed dextran coated charcoal and 125 I glucagon. Mean concentration in normal fasting children was 153 pg/ml +/- 27 (S.E.M.) and the molar ratio of insulin/glucagon was between 1,9 and 3,9. In the case of premature, dysmature and diabetic children or children from diabetic mothers, the levels did not differ significantly from normal. Results of glucagon secretion stimulation tests using arginine insulin combinations are also reported.
