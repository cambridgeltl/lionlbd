Computing the mean duration of breastfeeding from current-status data.
Two types of data are frequently employed in the study of breast feeding duration: retrospective reports on time of weaning and current status reports of whether or not the woman is breast feeding at the time of the survey. The mean duration of breast feeding can be calculated: 1) as a sum of the proportions still experiencing the given behavior in each month or current status mean (CS), or 2) as the total number still experiencing the behavior divided by average number of observations in each month or prevalence/incidence (P/I) mean. These two methods of calculating mean duration of breast feeding using current status data were examined. Various ways were outlined in which basic assumptions behind the P/I method (stationarity of births) could be violated as well as the consequences of those violations. A simple empirical test of the P/I method using the last 5 years from 40 World Fertility Survey and 22 Demographic Health Survey samples showed that the P/I using a 2-year window to compute the incidence performed best relative to the current status mean. In the case of contraceptive prevalence surveys where only the date of the last birth is given, a 1-year window is preferable, but the variability of estimates makes comparisons between groups or across time difficult unless differences are quite large. In these situations (where the current status mean would be biased) it was shown that a measure that combines the current status and the P/I means, but was based only on last births, more accurately reflected the current status based on all births than did the P/I mean. Nevertheless, the current status mean would seem to be preferable in cases when the requisite data on all births in a fixed time period were available.
