Physical signs in association with depressive illness in childhood.
Although behavioural disturbances associated with depression in childhood are often discussed, descriptions of somatic phenomena are less commonly reported. This paper compares the frequency of neurological signs observed in a group of depressed children with a control group. The possibility that minimal brain dysfunction might play a part in the production of signs is considered. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference between the incidence of physical signs found in the control group and in the depressed children.
