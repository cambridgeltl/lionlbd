Multichannel biotelemetry.
A summary of considerations for design and application of multichannel biotelemetry systems is given. The advantages but also the problems of wired, wireless, combined and storage telemetry are discussed in connection with its application. Modulation and multiplexing techniques are described extensively; however, this review focuses not only on the transmission of biological data but also on the important aspects of connection of the transmission equipment to the biological subject and display of the biological information. The topic of multichannel biotelemetry is rounded off by a few additional subjects such as telecontrol, information source and classification.
