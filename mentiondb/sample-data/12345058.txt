Mortality by sex, age, and cause of death, in European and highly developed extra-European countries in the years 1960-1984.
"A comparative analysis of mortality, in which standardized death rates...were used, was conducted for 24 European and 5...[other] developed countries. The analysis shows that in spite of medical progress in fighting high mortality stemming from primary sources (diseases of [the] circulatory system and malignant neoplasms), its very high level is still registered in many Middle and Eastern European countries (especially in Hungary, in former Czechoslovakia and Poland). A high increase of premature mortality of men aged 45-64 is also observed."
