ORS -- outstanding issues.
Over the past 25 years, the composition of oral rehydration solution (ORS) has undergone a number of changes based on physiologic and clinical studies. The sodium and carbohydrate contents are most important in the correction of dehydration. The exact composition of ORS will probably continue to evolve over the next few years, because: 1) It is important to have a single ORS, so that all patients with dehydrating diarrheas of any cause and in any age group can be successfully treated with the same solution. 2) It would be desirable to have an ORS that would also lead to a decrease in the diarrhea, in addition to being a rehydration fluid. A patient with diarrhea loses essential fluids and electrolytes as watery stool. If these are not replaced, the patient may die from the consequent reduction in blood supply to the vital organs. There are about 4 billion diarrheal episodes in the world per year, or 11 million per day. More than 90% of them occur in less developed countries. Half of all diarrheal episodes do not need medical treatment, and 40% can be treated at home using ORS alone. Only 10% need clinical care, using a combination of ORS, intravenous fluid, and drugs. Research must address the following proposed modification in the ORS: cereals, particularly rice, may be used as the source of carbohydrates instead of pure sucrose or glucose. This modification leads to a decreased stool output, particularly marked in patients with cholera. The main issues are how to ensure that ORS is widely available in the world and how to educate mothers about using the solution effectively. Potential global savings in health care costs from optimal home use of ORS to treat diarrhea would be  10-15 billion per year. Correct ORS use could save an additional two million lives each year.
