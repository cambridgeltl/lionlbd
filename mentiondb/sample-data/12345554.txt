Editorial.
Governments in most countries have health problems and priorities other than AIDS education and prevention to consider. Cultural and religious conservatism especially cause politicians and bureaucrats to shy away from AIDS-related issues. Nongovernmental organizations instead play a vital role in AIDS and STD education and prevention. PASA welcomes the formation of the AIDS Task Force of Fiji and the Coral Life Foundation in Guam, and looks forward to working with the organizations. Providing information and knowledge about sex does not encourage people to have sex, but helps them make informed decisions about what they want to do. The author stresses the need to respect people's right to choose their own sexual destinies even when they do not coincide with ours.
