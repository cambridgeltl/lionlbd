A family decision. The Muslim view.
A teacher from the International Islamic University in Islamabad, Pakistan, provides his views on family planning (FP) and population control among Muslims. Many scholars believe that FP is against Islamic teachings. This position is taken because many view the Prophet as not objecting to contraception but never encouraging mass population control. The Prophet approved of coitus interruptus in past times when men traveled widely and could not afford pregnancy and child birth. The Prophet did not approve of the Jewish practice of using methods to avoid pregnancy for economic reasons; this was considered a form of infanticide. The Koran indicates that resources are available for every human being born into this world, and the task is to discover and toil for those resources. The Prophet says that Muslims should increase their numbers, through conversion and procreation. Wealth, beauty, social status, piety, and moral character are considerations in choosing a spouse. A wife should be loving, procreative, and righteous. Illicit and extramarital relationships are expressly prohibited. Contraceptive use campaigns are considered as contributory to promiscuity and the weakening of the moral fiber of society. A tradeoff between economic benefit and moral degeneration is not worth it. The experiences in America and Europe provide ample evidence of the consequences. Muslim scholars do not believe that population growth is the main malady in developing countries.
