Election '94: a population overview.
President Bill Clinton has been more outspoken and active than previous presidents in negotiations leading to the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. He has put population stabilization at the top of the overall foreign policy agenda, sending to Congress a bill designed to make sustainable development and population stabilization cornerstones of US foreign policy. Moreover, the administration's commitment to solving the population problem is reflected in each of the two budgets submitted to Congress with increased funds requested and received for international family planning and the UN Population Fund. The US now leads the search for new solutions to the problem of rapid population growth. The right-wing conservatism and ignorance of the Reagan-Bush years, however, threatens to return following the November 1994 national elections. Historically, the party which controls the White House loses Congressional seats during mid-term elections. If the Democrats lose up to fifteen seats, the shift will be an historical norm. A Democratic loss of 25 or more seats, however, may pose a serious problem for Clinton. Domestic and international family planning, sex education, health care, abortion, and environmental protection all hang in the balance. During this period of increased partisanship, 36 of the 44 Republicans in the Senate supported a Helms amendment to limit US participation in the Cairo conference. Republican control of the Senate would likely keep the US from carrying out the commitments made at the conference on family planning, women's health coverage, and environmental protection.
