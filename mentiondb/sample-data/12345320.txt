Preventive methods badly needed.
Concern about the low birth rate is allegedly leading Romanian officials to consider restrictions on abortion on demand, possibly a policy limiting abortion to cases of contraceptive failure. Preferable would be an approach that promotes the use of reliable methods, such as the pill and IUD. At present, the calendar and temperature methods of natural family planning are widely used. This, in turn, would require the recruitment and training of more family planning doctors and nurses and a national educational campaign to overcome negative messages about contraceptive side-effects that were implanted by the pro-natalist Ceausescu regime. There are encouraging signs, however. A political climate that encourages the open discussion of sexuality exists, and all women undergoing abortion are not referred to a family planning clinic for contraceptive counseling.
