China. Training courses upgrade personnel of population education in peasant schools.
From July to September 1993, more than 120 officers and teachers of the project, CPR/90/P20 (Population Education in Peasant Schools), received training to improve their effectiveness. 19 officers and teachers attended a 3-week training course (July 11, 1993 to August 1993) offered by the University of the Philippines, which covered puberty education, teaching methods, curricula and instructional materials development, and principles and methods for evaluating population education. 22 officers and teachers received training in Bangkok during a 2-week program (August 8-22, 1993) organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific. Experts and specialists from different United Nations agencies presented lectures and practica on various aspects of population and development and population education; the training provided a multidisciplinary view or program approach to the population issues. 100 teachers and administrators from Population Education Teachers Training Centres and pilot schools attended a workshop in Shanghai (September 4-10, 1993) that provided information on implementing the program (concept goals and methodologies of population education, teaching methods, curriculum development and evaluation). Participants were then asked to apply what they had learned during various practical exercises. In order to ascertain their effectiveness in teaching population education, they were divided into 3 groups which evaluated 3 pilot schools and contact points located in 3 counties around Shanghai.
