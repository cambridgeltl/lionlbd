Long-acting methods require special care.
Long-acting contraceptive methods including IUDs, implants, and sterilization are among the most effective and convenient contraceptive methods, requiring little or no effort on the part of the user once provided by a trained healthcare provider. Some women, however, oppose the development and use of provider-dependent contraceptive methods due to the potential for method misuse. These methods, for example, could be provided without women's fully informed choice, access to removal could be blocked, or the method could be provided to an inappropriate client. Making a contraceptive method unavailable because of potential abuse instead restricts women's reproductive choices. After all, abuse generally comes from the legal or delivery system, not from the method itself. Efforts should be made to satisfy users with standard norms for performance and without targets for specific methods. Good service delivery along with revised approaches to contraceptive introduction and program evaluation can help prevent inappropriate method use and ensure that women receive adequate information and counseling to help them make reproductive choices without undue influence. The author discusses Norplant delivery, providing IUDs, offering sterilization, and improving access.
