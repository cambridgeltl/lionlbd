The effects of in- and out-migration on urban growth in Turkey (1965-85) and a comparison with the developed countries.
The author examines the relative weight of pull and push factors affecting rural-urban migration in Turkey. Data are from the 1970, 1980, and 1985 censuses. "The results of this study indicate that, for the Turkish case, the effects of migration on urban growth had been contrary to those found in the developed countries, but that, as Turkish development increased over the time period 1965-85, the effects of migration increasingly came to resemble those of developed countries."
