Putting the women's network into action. Philippines.
A UNFPA-funded program, Sustainable Community-based Family Planning-Maternal/Child Health Project with Special Focus on Women, has received the full support of government authorities in the Philippines. In attendance at an orientation and planning workshop were the governor and the mayors of the proposed sites of the project: Batangas Province's Balayan and Malvar municipalities. Baseline surveys conducted in these municipalities had revealed both a lack of knowledge about preventive health and family planning and the absence of quality health care services. The discussion at the workshop emphasized the importance of community participation, strategies for involving women's groups in community health activities, and a need for cost sharing and program sustainability. The strategy selected was to build upon health activities already being carried out by women's organizations, including nutrition education and renovation of health substations.
