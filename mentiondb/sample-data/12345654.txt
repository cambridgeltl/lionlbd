Family planning and development.
Women in many countries are of only very low social standing with limited control over resources and the circumstances in which they live. Levels of infant and child mortality are also very high in many areas of the world. In the attempt to rear progeny which survive into adulthood, these women bear many children. Children are a source of labor and power who can gather fuel, cook, fetch water, perform other chores, and ultimately provide security for elderly parents. Were rates of infant and child mortality to decline and women to have more opportunity to earn livelihoods on their own, however, they would not need to bear quite so many children. Levels of fertility would decline in keeping with the goals of family planning programs around the world. The direct relationship between women's poverty, women's lack of autonomy, and high fertility requires one to address the complete range of women's reproductive needs instead of focusing narrowly upon the distribution of contraceptives. To that end, some family planning and economic development programs have merged to provide contraceptive services which are linked with broader efforts to improve health, education, and employment. Program experiences are discussed.
