Management of high risk mothers and maternal mortality in Indian population.
The logistic model used in this study revealed a 0.99923 probability of maternal mortality associated with severe anemia, hemorrhage, and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Sensitivity of the model was 89.47%, and accuracy of prediction was 80.7% Other risk factors included in the regression were sepsis, hyperpyrexia, and birth interval. The study sample included 252 maternal deaths occurring between January 1, 1983, and December 21, 1985, at Safdarung Hospital in New Delhi, India, matched to controls; multivariate analysis was performed with 57 matched cases. The risk of anemia alone was nine times higher among women with this history. The adjusted odds ratio with severe anemia and controlling for pregnancy-induced hypertension increased to 9.151. The odds ratio for severe anemia when controlling for pregnancy-induced hypertension and hemorrhage was 8.783. The odds ratio with severe anemia and controls for hemorrhage, hyperpyrexia, and short birth interval was 9.980. The odds ratio with severe anemia and controls for hemorrhage, hyperpyrexia, short birth interval, and pregnancy-induced hypertension was 9.945. With severe anemia and controls for the remaining five risk factors, the odds ratio was 7.010. Management of high-risk mothers should reduce maternal mortality.
