[France ages, but regional differences are diminishing].
Regional variations in demographic aging in France are analyzed, using official data including the 1990 census.

However, they also note that these differences have decreased over the past 15 years, primarily due to the migration of those under age 50 from the north to the south. (SUMMARY IN ENG AND SPA)
