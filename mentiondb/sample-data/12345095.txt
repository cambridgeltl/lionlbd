Anthropology and HIV /AIDS prevention in Kenya. New ways of cooperation.
In eastern Africa within the past 10 years, anthropologists, clinicians, and public health specialists have developed a condensed form of anthropology known as Rapid Assessment Procedures (RAP) which uses interviews, conversation, questionnaires, participant observation, and focus group discussions. The RAP techniques are used with triangulation, which involves the use of 2 or more methods to address a single research issue. RAP was established in East Africa in 1989 during a workshop for researchers and health workers involved in AIDS prevention. A group of 5 social and health scientists based at the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) participated in the training. RAP has proven an effective tool for addressing STD/AIDS prevention among long distance truck drivers operating on the Mombasa-Nairobi-Uganda highway. RAP was used to identify the social and cultural characteristics of the truck drivers. AMREF discovered that the truck drivers, petrol station attendants, commercial sex workers, and restaurant workers along the highway comprised a closely knit sub-culture. Informal interviews were used to discuss individual perceptions, fears, and concerns. A number of factors, such as having multiple sex partners, non-use of condoms, and self-treatment for STDs, facilitated STD/HIV transmission. HIV/AIDS was regarded as an invisible disease, affecting foreigners, and plump women were believe to be free of the disease. Positive AIDS prevention messages were developed by using RAP techniques and focus group discussions. Condom use has increased, and truck drivers seek early treatment for STDs. Communities within the various truck stop points have started planning STD/AIDS prevention programs. Originally funded by FHI/AIDSTECH, the program is now spreading along the major truck routes in Kenya. In neighboring Tanzania, a more extensive program is well underway.
