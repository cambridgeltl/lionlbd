One woman's crusade. An interview with Dr. Mawaheb T. El Mouelhy.
The views and background of the 1992 recipient of the Organon Family Planning Scholarship, the Egyptian El Mouelhy, were summarized; a report was also provided on the population views of Egyptian Dr. Maher Mahran, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Ain Shams University and director of the Egyptian National Population Council (NPC). El Mouelhy stated that the population problem in Egypt is a reflection of 98% of the population being settled on only 4% of the land area. The average number of children per family is 4, and the growth rate is 2.4%. Population growth is expected to reach 93 million, a doubling by 2025. Illiterates have the highest fertility; illiteracy in rural areas can be as high as 6.4%. Her solution is to rely on the cooperative efforts of government and nongovernmental groups to improve the status of women. Dr. Mahran reports that one goal of the NPC is to encourage redistribution of the population along the northern coast and Red Sea areas and to develop satellite communities outside Cairo. There are currently 14,000 societies in Egypt devoted to the goals of family planning and better health care for women and children. Local health motivators have also been successful at outreach. The location of the Third UN World Population Conference in Cairo this year is a positive impetus to the family planning effort. Egypt is the first Muslim country to reach 50% contraceptive use. NPC will be directing efforts to underserved rural areas. El Mouelhy on her return will be preparing a national population plan of action.
