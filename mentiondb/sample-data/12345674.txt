The priorities of the ICPD.
For the first time in world history, governments around the world are united to address population growth and sustainable development. More than one hundred heads of states and prime ministers have signed a population stabilization declaration. The three preparatory meetings, six expert group meetings, five regional meetings, three roundtable meetings, national meetings, parliamentary meetings, and NGO forum meetings which took place in preparation for the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) attest to the commitment of participants and planners to have the most serious and fruitful conference and resolution possible. During these preparatory meetings, the ICPD has created a sense of awareness about the population problem, erased population illiteracy among a very difficult group of policymakers and parliamentarians, and created an international population club. The ICPD is different because it will transform the heightened awareness of current population issues into operative strategies for effective and comprehensive programs. The priorities are different from those of the Bucharest and Mexico conferences. The Cairo conference will focus upon the development of human resources through education and health; the complex relationship among population, resources, environment, and development; the serious problem of consumption; the status of women in regard to socioeconomic development; the rapid increase in urbanization and migration; the increasing number of international migrants and refugees; population aging; and human sexuality, AIDS, and sexually transmitted diseases. Egypt will join donors in helping to train in the fields of demography, statistics, family planning, and rural development.
