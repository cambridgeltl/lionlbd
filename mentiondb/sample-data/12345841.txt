Towards a new global strategy.
Many of the country reports submitted to the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development identify uncontrolled population growth as a major obstacle to socioeconomic development. The Population Council has estimated that provision of family planning services to all couples who wish to avoid another birth could reduce the Third World population from 8.6 billion in 1995 to 7.5 billion in 2050. Even more significant would be decreases in the demand for additional children through increased female access to education and employment, decreased emphasis on the value of sons over daughters, validation of women's nonmaterial social roles, and improved child survival. If the average age at first childbirth rose by 2.5 years between 1995-2020, the population momentum would decrease by 2.2 billion. The United National Development Program is promoting the concept of sustainable human development. This encompasses economic growth, the equitable distribution of income, regeneration of the environment, and empowerment rather than marginalization of Third World People. A 20-20 proposal, in which developing countries would allocate 20% of their budgets and donors would earmark 20% of their aid to human development programs, has been recommended as a means of financing this goal. Implementation of this scheme would release US 30-40 billion each year from existing resources for policy interventions that would accelerate the transition to lower rates of fertility.
