Editorial.
Even though India was the first country to address population, it is behind those who came later. The government of India framed population within the context of health, but it eventually shifted the approach to health and family planning. Compartmentalism and adhoc-ism removed the programs far from the people. Eventually family welfare replaced family planning. The 8 Five Year Plan document provides a framework for appropriate, positive change in addressing the population issue. Yet, contraceptive intervention, particularly tubectomy, remains the core of population issues. In fact, tubectomy increased from about 11% of total sterilizations in the late 1960s to 96% in 1994. Women remain the target of population control. In fact, female-targeted contraceptive technology has produced IUDs, oral contraceptives, tubectomy, subdermal contraceptive implants, and the injectable contraceptive. Improvement of women's health services, their status, and their economic independence has not been attempted. Before improvement can occur, female literacy; skill development; meeting of basic needs of food, water, and health care for children to survive; and safe living and working conditions are needed. Male responsibility has risen somewhat over time. India needs to work towards a shift from contraception-oriented population control to reducing births by choice (RBBC), making RBBC a grassroots movement, a holistic approach, coordination between various government agencies, addressing demographic fundamentalism (e.g., son preference and child marriage), provision of primary health care, and equitable distribution of local and global resources. Population policy must be human.
