[Reflections on the problem of adolescent fertility in Zaire].
Trends in adolescent fertility in Zaire are examined. The author describes how traditional constraints on adolescent sexual behavior are breaking down, particularly in urban areas where young people are more exposed to the influence of cultures other than their own. Consideration is given also to unwanted adolescent pregnancy and to induced abortion.
