Unmet need from a woman's health perspective.
It is difficult for researchers to ascertain unmet need for family planning services by using current definitions and by basing data on various surveys which phrase questions differently in order to achieve specific research and planning purposes. Conventional estimates of unmet need include only married women who want to postpone or avoid childbearing but are not using contraception. Expanding the definition will allow the special needs of the following various groups to be recognized and met: 1) sexually active unmarried women, especially teenagers; 2) women with postpartum amenorrhea; 3) women using a less effective contraceptive method; 4) women using a more effective method who use it incorrectly, are dissatisfied, or have contraindications to its use; 5) women with unwanted pregnancies without access to safe and affordable abortion services; and 6) women with related reproductive health problems. Thus, the definition of unmet need has several layers. The first layer is to provide contraception to those who are not using it. The second is to provide a more effective, satisfactory, or safe method. The third layer is for safe treatment of contraceptive failure (or nonuse), and the fourth is for such reproductive health services as infertility treatment and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. Many questions remain about identifying the women and men with unmet needs, about the reasons their needs are not met, about the determinants of acceptability of contraception, and about the best research approaches to determine people's attitudes about contraceptive usage and service delivery in different settings.
