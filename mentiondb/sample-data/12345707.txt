[When people born in French overseas departments return home to retire. A survey of intentions].
"Almost half of...over-45s born in French overseas departments and living in mainland France had plans to return overseas by the year 2000. The desire to return is more clear-cut among the 50 to 54 year olds. The younger people have yet to think seriously about retirement, whilst a number of the oldest individuals have already made definite plans." Data are from a survey carried out in 1992.
