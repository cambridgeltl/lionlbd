[Cohort fertility and the Cigno model].
The author examines determinants of completed fertility, intended fertility, and child-accumulation tempo in Japan by applying the Cigno model. Independent variables such as wife's family size are used to investigate the validity of the inclusive fitness hypothesis and the only-child reaction hypothesis concerning the relation between fertility and family size. Consideration is given to the impact of parental educational status, wives' employment, coresidence with the couple's parents, and desired family size. Data concern the 1960s. An English abstract is available from the author on request.
