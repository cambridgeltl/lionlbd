Calibration and measurement in 3-dimensional monitoring of human motion by optoelectronic means. I. Preliminaries and theoretical aspects.
By combinding the obervations from a number of independent direction sensors, the spatial positions of one or more targets may be reconstructed. The theory of calibration and measurement in a computerized, interactive environment is discussed in the terminology of analytical photogrammetry, for applications in the field of biomechanics. The discussion is focussed upon optoelectronic system for movement monitoring in real-time rather than upon photography as is the conventional photogrammetric implementation.
