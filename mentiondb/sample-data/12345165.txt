Birth seasonality, photoperiod, and social change in the central Canadian Arctic.
The seasonal distribution of births in a Canadian Inuit community located 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle is analyzed over a period of several decades. A significant shift from pronounced seasonality of births in the 1970s to nonseasonality in the 1980s is noted. Reasons for this change are discussed, including modernization and the decline of traditional life-styles.
