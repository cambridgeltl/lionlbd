Lack of micronutrients hits mothers and infants hardest.
People most affected by deficiencies in micronutrients (e.g., iron, vitamin A, and iodine) are pregnant women and children. Vitamin A deficiency suppresses the body's ability to fight infection, induces eye disease, and may result in blindness. A lactating mother's need for vitamin A is 30-60% greater than when she was pregnant. If a mother has enough vitamin A reserves, the breastfed child receives enough vitamin A. Healthy development of hemoglobin in the blood depends on iron and folic acid. Anemia results if the body does not have enough of these elements. 50% of all the pregnant women in the world have anemia. This figure is even higher in developing countries. Menstruation results in a loss of iron each month in women, so women need twice as much iron as men. Extra iron during pregnancy is needed for the fetus and to build maternal blood volume. Diet alone does not satisfy iron and folic acid needs during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Some areas in the world are deficient in iodine, so people often develop iodine deficiency, resulting in growth of the thyroid gland. The gland produces fewer thyroid hormones in people with serious iodine deficiencies. Hypothyroidism may slow growth and mental development in neonates, leading to cretinism. Iodine deficient pregnant women have more stillbirths, miscarriages, and low birth weight infants. Prescription supplements of micronutrients during prenatal visits and children's exams prevents the worst effects of micronutrient deficiency. All pregnant women should receive iron supplements. All women of childbearing age, particularly pregnant women, and children in geographic areas with insufficient micronutrients should receive vitamin A and iodine supplements.
