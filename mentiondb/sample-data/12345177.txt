Rural-urban migration in economic development.
"This paper provides a review of the theoretical literature on rural-urban migration in contemporary LDCs [less developed countries]. The paper begins with a brief discussion of the Lewis model before going on to discuss the Todaro and the Harris-Todaro models and the large literature which these models have spawned. The question of job search in the context of migration and the role of family members in migration decisions are considered next. The paper then takes a closer look at the Informal sector and also sets out alternative migration functions to the ones usually employed in the literature."
