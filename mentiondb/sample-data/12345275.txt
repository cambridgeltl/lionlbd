When less is more.
Thailand's world rank, based on its total fertility rate (the average number of children that will be born per child-bearing woman, given current trends) of 2.3, has decreased from 70 in 1960 to 33 in 1991 (the country with the lowest rate is ranked 1st). By 1989, it was also listed 7th for world's fastest growing economy. This is due, perhaps, to the improved health and education that accompanies a lower fertility rate. This news article lists total fertility rates and world rankings for the years 1960 and 1991 for 76 countries. Total fertility rates alone are listed for an additional 7 countries.
