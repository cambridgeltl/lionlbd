Trend of change in various kinds of nuclear families in China since the 1980s.
"By using the latest data of 1% sampled data made in the Fourth Population Survey in 1990 and 1 [per 1,000], sampled data made in the Third Population Survey in 1982, we have attempted an analysis...of the trend of change of proportion among nuclear parents-families, separated-parents, single-parent and interval-generation families, as well as two-, three- and four-generation lineal and joint families in China during the 1980s, both as a nation and in all provinces, municipalities directly under the central government and autonomous regions."
