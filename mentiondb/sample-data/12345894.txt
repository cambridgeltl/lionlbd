Population policies gain momentum among African countries.
The Kilimanjaro Programme of Action on Population (KPA) in 1984 emphasized population as the central component in formulating and implementing development policies and programs of African countries. This was reemphasized by the Africa Priority Programme for Economic Recovery (APPER) and the United Nations Programme of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development (UNPAAERD, 1986-1990). Liberia (1985), Zaire (1987), Nigeria (1988), Senegal (1988), and Zambia (1989) have adopted population policies. Ethiopia, Madagascar, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Togo have prepared draft policies. Benin, Guinea, Niger, Sao-Tome, and Principe have expressed interest in adopting policies. The Third National Population Conference (1987) in Sudan outlined a national population policy. African countries are adopting family planning programs for 3 reasons: 1) improving child and maternal health; 2) human rights; and/or 3) moderating demographic trends. Algeria, Burundi, Egypt, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Mauritius, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Tunisia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have adopted population policies where population growth is reduced by controlling fertility.
