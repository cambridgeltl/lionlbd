The highest priority: how can the NAM countries continue to expand and improve the ways they learn from each other?
The author opens with a discussion of the content of population programs and the ongoing process of learning from and helping each other. Population programs used to be so narrowly defined that they were detached from important sociocultural, economic, and political realities. That definition, however, is now expanding beyond the notions of demography and family planning to accommodate the need to adjust programs to meet family needs and not vice versa. Family development is called for instead of family planning. His experience in Indonesia has shown him that simple solutions tend not to work; strong and consistent political commitment to the promotion of development is needed; bureaucrats must be honest, competent, and committed to national development; self-sustained development will not happen unless people feel they have a stake in it as both recipients and decision makers; a community-based approach is required; coercion has no place in population programs; and women are more important than men. The author also discusses how advances in science and technology initially exacerbate inequalities, the potentially positive role of governments, keys to a viable population program, making a stronger contribution, and how to pay for South-South collaboration.
