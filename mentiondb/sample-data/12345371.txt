Appeal to adolescents in Ethiopia.
In response to inadequate knowledge about family planning on the part of adolescents in Ethiopia, the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia (FGAE) established a Youth Counseling and Reproductive Health Services Center in Addis Ababa in 1990. The Center, situated in a recreational facility popular with young people, offered clinical services, information, and counseling. 65% of those served by the Center were out-of-school adolescents. To reach in-school youth, the program was extended to target 10 secondary schools, each of which has a volunteer teacher coordinator and 2 peer promoters. The coordinators and peer promoters organize family life education groups, provide educational materials, distribute non-prescription contraceptives, and refer teens to the Youth Center for clinical services. Since 1990, over 20,000 adolescents have participated in family life education sessions, 5200 have become consistent condom users, 600 have received counseling, and 500 have attended the Youth Center's family planning clinic. In addition, over 100,000 parents have attended plays performed by a drama troupe affiliated with the project. The National Voice of Ethiopia has made 20 minutes/day of radio time available to the project for broadcasts on topics such as unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. The success of this effort has been striking, given the fact that Ethiopia has no official population policy.
