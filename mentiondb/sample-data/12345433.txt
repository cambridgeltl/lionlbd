Demographic characteristics of tribal and non-tribal females--comparative study.
"This paper aims at finding out the socio-demographic perspective of...tribal and non-tribal females [in India] through a concrete pattern of field survey. The data gathered from 3,428 tribal and 2,447 non-tribal females have been analysed to examine the trends of differences in the status enjoyed by these women belonging to two different communities." Consideration is given to differences in literacy, nuptiality, marriage age, age structure, fertility, family planning, and infant mortality.
