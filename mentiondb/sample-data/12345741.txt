Reaching unserved poor communities. The MEXFAM Community Doctors Programme.
MEXFAM established the Community Doctors Program in 1986 to deliver, at modest cost, health and family planning services to low-income populations in areas not served by government or other agencies. An initial cohort of 49 doctors opened modest doctor's offices from which they provided services at fees affordable by the community with the goal of eventually becoming self-sufficient as a micro-enterprise in an economically deprived area. MEXFAM has collected data to evaluate the project since its beginning in 1986. Women were the main users of the centers and most of them visited for reasons related to their children. Of very low educational and income level, most of the women rated the services as satisfactory or highly satisfactory. Women doctors seemed to be better accepted. The program expanded over the years to enable the association to successfully work with 250 doctors in 1993. Lessons learned over the years have been incorporated to form the current program model. The author also notes that the rate of program expansion has slowed since 1992 and only twelve doctors will join the program in 1994. Furthermore, departing from previous practice, new community doctors do not purchase their equipment and furniture at the end of two years and become independent. The doctors instead rent their equipment after the initial subsidies are terminated. They are then supervised and continue to receive training from MEXFAM. The physicians remain eligible to buy contraceptives and other items from MEXFAM at a price which allows the organization to recover costs.
