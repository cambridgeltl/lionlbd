Traditional methods still widely used.
Although Moroccan law allows abortion only if a woman's life is endangered, illegal abortion--often performed by traditional midwives using dangerous methods--is widespread. In a 1984 survey of 125 married women, 49 reported at least 1 abortion and 19 of these women had not consulted with their husband about this decision. 23 of these abortions were performed by traditional midwives. Many abortion seekers are unmarried women who face ostracism from Moroccan society should they carry a pregnancy to term. The ban on abortion has produced a network of physicians who will perform clandestine abortions in private clinics or their own surgeries. The cost range is US 95-175, placing it out of the reach of low-income women. Needed is access to effective contraception and safe abortion services. However, such measures will require Islam leaders to accept that growing numbers of Moroccan youth are engaging in premarital sex and abandon their stance that all abortion seekers are sexually promiscuous unmarried women.
