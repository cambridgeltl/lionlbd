Still searching for a blueprint. Berlin Conference: struggling to save 9.5 million lives.
Central themes at the IX International Conference on Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) held in Berlin on June 7-11, 1993, included the inadequacy of current preventive efforts, the need for increased attention to community-based care, development of ways to protect and empower women, and the economic factors that trigger migration in developing countries to heavily infected urban centers. The conference was attended by 15,000 social and behavioral scientists, educators, and policymakers. World Health Organization (WHO) representative Michael Merson suggested that 9.5 million lives could be saved worldwide by the year 2000 if a greater emphasis is placed on AIDS prevention. Prevention activities of proven efficacy include condom distribution and promotion, treatment of the sexually transmitted diseases that facilitate infection with the AIDS virus, AIDS education in the schools and through the mass media, promotion of condom use by prostitutes and their clients, screening of blood products, and needle exchange programs for intravenous drug users. since the behaviors that place individuals at risk of AIDS are mediated by ethnicity and cultural traditions, preventive interventions should be adapted to local conditions and adjusted for cultural constraints. Merson set the cost of the comprehensive prevention program needed in the developing world at US 2.5 billion ( 264 for each of the 9.5 million lives saved), but when the direct and indirect costs of losing millions of young, potentially economic productive men and women are factored in, this expenditure would produce a longterm savings of  90 billion.
