Nation's most onerous abortion restrictions challenged in Mississippi court.
A lawsuit was filed in Mississippi on February 17, 1994, which challenges several aspects of Mississippi's abortion law. The case, Pro-choice Mississippi vs. Fordice, will seek to determine if the state's 24-hour delay and mandated information for abortion-seekers, 2-parent consent or court approval for young women, and licensing requirements for abortion providers violate the state Constitution both as written and as applied. At issue here are rights of privacy, bodily integrity, freedom of conscience, and the right to make a medical decision free from government interference. The 24-hour delay went into effect in August 1992. The parental consent was enacted in 1986 and went into effect in May 1993 because of another lawsuit, and the licensing requirements have been effective since their passage in November 1991 and have prevented qualified abortion providers from practicing in the State. The effect of these measures has been to reduce the number of abortions performed, especially for women with less than a high school education and to increase by an estimated 18% the number of second trimester abortions performed.
