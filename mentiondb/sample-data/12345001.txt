Infant nutrition and the consequences of differential market access in Nunoa, Peru.
The author observed and interviewed 30 women in August 1985, each of whom had at least 1 child under 3 years old, to analyze infant feeding behavior in the rural Andean community of Nunoa, Peru. Infants were generally first nursed within 48 hours of birth, subject to co-sleeping and probably night-nursing far longer than day nursing, and fed exclusively via bottle or nursing on only very rare occasions. Weaning periods were extended and consisted of continually modified feeding routines. Significant differences were observed between the feeding habits of poor and relatively less-poor mothers which may have impacted differently upon the health of offspring. The quality of infant foods and economic variation influenced breastfeeding duration and subsequent infant health and maternal fecundity. The author concludes that infant feeding routines can be neither characterized nor studied as a set of mutually exclusive hierarchical stages; significant variation exists within and between socioeconomic subsamples; both groups have parallel perceptions and attitudes regarding appropriate feeding practices; both groups perceive foods other than breast milk as complements to rather than substitutes for nursing during the 1st year of life; bottle use is neither uniformly harmful nor beneficial; the various aspects of infant feeding routines do not all necessarily respond in concert to changing socioeconomic conditions; models of infant feeding behavior must go beyond the simple mechanics of infant feeding; and great need exists for more comprehensive investigations.
