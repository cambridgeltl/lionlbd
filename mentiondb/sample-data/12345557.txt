From one woman's window. A "glimpse" into the Fiji sex trade.
The author discusses illegal prostitution in Fiji. She is a physician specializing in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) who has cared for more than 50% of Fiji's HIV-positive people. Although individual sex workers may be fined by the authorities and chastised in the press, there is no shortage of prostitutes who work night shifts, day shifts, and part time. Transvestites also work as commercial sex workers. Rates vary according to clientele with local men paying  5-10 for intercourse and tourists paying  20. Rates also vary according to type of sexual activity. No organized solidarity group or union exist for sex workers and most work individually guided by their needs and convenience often with regular clients. A few support groups are, however, developing. Workers have a tough time negotiating condom use. Many think taking a penicillin tablet daily will prevent STD, very few use the free government STD clinics, and very few have regular medical check-ups. The author notes in closing that social barriers prohibit effective outreach programs to prostitutes in Fiji.
