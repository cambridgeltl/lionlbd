[Politics of migration and the labor force. An approach for neo-corporatist arrangements].
The author examines the relationship between migration policy and the labor market in Switzerland. "The hypothesis we are developing in this article is that a neo-corporatist approach can explain how a migration policy is constructed. The process of this construction is in some way portending of the effects of this policy on the labor market and on the relations between the actors and organisations participating in it. This analysis is also an entry to some much more general problems that are linked with the implication of private actors in the public policies." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
