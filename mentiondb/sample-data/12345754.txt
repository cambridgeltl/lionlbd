The United Nations Population Fund and Planned Parenthood proudly present the International Conference on Population and Development.
The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) was orchestrated and largely controlled by such pro-choice groups as the UN Population Fund, Planned Parenthood, and radical American feminists. Efforts to promote abortion in parts of the world where it is illegal were couched in such terms as "safe motherhood" and "reproductive health." These efforts failed, however, with inclusion of the clause stating that abortion shall not be promoted as a means of family planning. However, the seeds of abortion, in the form of unnatural contraception, continue to be spread throughout the world. On the other hand, in the nongovernmental organization forum, which ran concurrently with the ICPD, pro-life organizations attracted a great deal of attention at the International Right to Life Federation booth. A workshop on natural family planning was attended by only a few people, but interest was high and the attendees followed-up by requesting more information during the Forum. A press conference held by Catholics for a Free Choice backfired because the mostly Moslem audience left angry at the women's apparent lack of obedience to the Pope. Other American feminists were confronted with the sight of women from the Third World picketing the conference with signs like "2 cars for every family in the North; one child for every family in the South." The pro-choice activists succeeded in bolstering the esteem of the Pope by making it evident that he is carrying the burden of family values almost singlehandedly.
