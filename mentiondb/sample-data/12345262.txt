Tendencies in adult mortality in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, 1970-1985. An international comparison.
"In order to evaluate mortality trends in adults aged 30-69 years in the State of Rio Grande do Sul [Brazil], changes in age-standardized mortality from 1970 to 1985 were calculated and compared with trends of 33 other countries. Virtual stability in Rio Grande do Sul over this 16-year period contrasts with dramatic reduction in age-standardized all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in many countries.... The data demonstrate that major declines in adult mortality can be achieved, and suggest that, during the period 1970-1985, Rio Grande do Sul participated little in the international tendency toward improved adult health."
