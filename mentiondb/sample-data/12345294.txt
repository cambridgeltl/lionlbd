[The first menstrual cycle in women after artificial interruption of the 1st pregnancy in the early term].
A great number of women experience menstrual disorders after an artificial interruption of the 1st pregnancy. This is most often the consequence of the removal of a fertilized egg, and of the sudden interruption of the functions of the corpus luteum and of the placenta. The menstrual functions of 168 women were studied before and after abortion. Most women had their first menstrual period from 30-34 days after the abortion and many complained about discharge between periods. The temperature of the women was monophasic. One might suspect the absence of an ovulatory peak of estrogen secretion during the first cycle following abortion. There appears to be a weakness in phase 2 of the cycle or an absence of corpus luteum activity. The secretion of luteinizing hormone appears reduced.
