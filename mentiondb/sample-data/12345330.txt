How can you combat unsafe abortion? Practical approaches in action.
Outlined are 7 strategies for combatting unsafe abortion, even in countries with limited resources and serious legal obstacles. One of the most basic tasks is to educate the public, political leaders, and health authorities about the harm and costs associated with unsafe abortion. To cultivate strong leadership for the campaign to improve access to safe abortion, coalitions of community and religious leaders and representatives from legal, medical, media, and social welfare sectors should be formed. Also important is the dissemination of research findings to government decision makers and donor agencies. Topics for study include: societal costs of unsafe abortion, measurement of abortion morbidity, contraceptive use following abortion, subpopulations of women (e.g., adolescents), and resource needs for improved services. The provision of vacuum aspiration instruments, infection prevention equipment, contraceptives, and printed technical materials can be important in countries with limited technology. Training programs for abortion care providers--midwives, private sector physicians, public sector hospital staff, and post-abortion family planning personnel-can be used to introduce improved technology. Where possible, high quality, comprehensive abortion services can be provided directly to women. Finally, international collaboration and experience sharing among those working to combat unsafe abortion is urged.
