The impact of 25 years of "Humanae Vitae".
In 1968, Pope Paul VI reinforced the Catholic Church's position forbidding contraception in an encyclical known as "Humanae Vitae." The current Pope, John Paul II, has reiterated this position and stated that use of condoms is forbidden, even to prevent HIV transmission. Several public figures, including the IPPF President and the British Overseas Development Minister, have sought to initiate a dialogue with the Pope to express concern about population growth in developing countries. The Catholic Church is currently opposing efforts on the part of the Presidents of Peru and the Philippines to expand access to family planning (FP) programs. Many of the 500,000 women who die each year of pregnancy complications would have used contraceptives and lived, and an estimated 300 million developing world couples have no access to modern contraception, yet desire no more children. Many Catholics disagree with the Church's stance; 87% of US Catholics surveyed in 1992 stated that FP is the couple's choice. After 25 years of "Humanae Vitae," it is time for the Church to enter into dialogue and join efforts to improve life on earth in the next century.
