The emergence of the nuclear family: its effect on women's roles and fertility change in Nigeria.
A survey of Yoruba women was carried out in 1986 in the urban areas of Ibadan and Ilesa and four villages in Nigeria which focused on the relationships between the status of married women and their fertility. A total of 2176 married women and their husbands were randomly selected and interviewed on marriage, pregnancy and fertility histories, employment histories, wife's purchasing power, social and political participation, and knowledge and practice of family planning (FP). At least 60% of the women had formal education (primary, secondary, or university). About one-fifth had no formal education and the same proportion had only Koranic or vocational education. The proportion that had formal education was higher in urban areas (63.8%) than in rural areas (53.2%) and those with no formal education were more in rural (28%) than in urban areas (15.6%). 69.1% of husbands had formal education vs. 60.5% of wives; and 72.5% of husbands were educated in urban areas vs. 61.4% in rural areas. Nine-tenths of the women worked full-time and one-tenth worked part-time. 85% of the husbands received income below Naira (N) 600 a month. In rural areas 89.5% of husbands had such low income; the percentage was lower in urban areas. A higher proportion of husbands living in urban areas than in rural areas earned an income above this level. Also a higher proportion of women living in urban areas earned higher incomes than women living in rural areas. The median household income ranged between N401 and N600, and it was earned in 29.5% of urban households vs. 25.1% of rural households. About 16% of the rural households earned less than N200 compared with 5.5% of urban households. The mean number of children ever born (CEB) was higher for rural women than for urban women with a household income below N200 and above N800. Households with income between N401 and N800 had higher fertility in urban than in rural areas.
