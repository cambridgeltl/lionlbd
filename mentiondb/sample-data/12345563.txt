25 years of ORS discovery celebrated.
Therapy with oral rehydration solution (ORS) in 1971 reduced cholera death rates from 50% to 3% among thousands of refugees of the War of Liberation which culminated in Bangladesh's independence. ORS has since saved the lives of millions of children around the world. An award-giving ceremony presided over by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh was held at the International Conference Center in Dhaka to celebrate the discovery of ORS by the Bangladesh International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research. It was hoped that such an event would lead to improved effectiveness for ORS and raise awareness of the role and cost effectiveness of international health research. Ministers, secretaries, ambassadors, and international health leaders from around the world were present. Vowing continued government support for the center and urging comparable international support, the Prime Minister congratulated everyone associated with the discovery of ORS. She also thanked NGOs, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF for popularizing its the use of ORS nationally and internationally. A postage stamp commemorated for the event was released.
