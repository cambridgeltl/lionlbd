"Positive and living" in Zambia.
In issue 20, we were encouraged to read about people living with HIV or AIDS taking control over their own lives. We belong to a support group in Lusaka called the PALS (Positive and Living Squad). At first we met to discuss our hopes and fears and strengthen each other emotionally. But we realized that this was not enough. Members wanted to do something about their human rights and about AIDS. We set up an education program--training HIV-positive members to run AIDS workshops, particularly in workplaces. PALS also liaises closely with AIDS support organizations, helping with their organizations, helping with their outreach programs, and meeting their clients. Some members are also involved in income-generating activities--usually the ones who decide not to be trained as educators. But we find that many members find it difficult to set up their own businesses, even with loans and training. They are used to being paid employees and find it hard to work without a boss] The biggest difficulty for a self-help group like The PALS is this. Of the 7 people who were very active in 1992, 3 have died and 2 are very ill. As a result, it is hard to keep on working--morale drops and anxiety levels increase. Despite these issues, The PALS is demonstrating every day what the power of positive living can achieve. You cannot talk about AIDS prevention and care, and empowering people with HIV/AIDS, without promoting self-help groups. Yes, we have problems, but these are not all because of our HIV status. Most of them are just due to human nature. So, to everyone trying to set up or support the work of self-help groups, we wish you luck and strength--and 'more grease to your elbow']
