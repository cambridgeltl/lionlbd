A thoroughly regressive law.
Severe restrictions on the availability of safe, legal abortion in Poland have been imposed, despite a tremendous need for abortion as a back-up in cases of failure of natural family planning methods--the most prevalent form of fertility control in this Catholic-dominated country. The new law, Protection of the Human Fetus and Conditions for Legal Abortion, permits abortion only when pregnancy endangers the life or health of the mother or when it is the result of rape or incest. Physicians who perform illegal abortions face 2 years in prison. Hospitals had earlier stopped performing abortions in response to the 1991 Code of Medical Ethics adopted by the second national congress of physicians. The code states, "Medical activity which carries with it a risk to the life of the embryo is permitted only when it is the only means of saving the life and health of the mother, as well as in cases where pregnancy is a result of crime." By November 1992, the government commission that drafted the new law had received 12,190 letters, 58% of which were opposed to the anti-abortion law. This is consistent with public opinion polls indicating that 65% of Poles are against penalization for performing an abortion, even for social indications.
