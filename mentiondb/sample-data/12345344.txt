[Changes in the demographic life course].
"The decision to live alone after leaving the parental home, to cohabit, to marry, or to become [a] mother for the first time, as well as the ages at which these decisions occur, characterize the individual demographic life-course. Based on the first results of the 1993 [Netherlands] Family and Fertility Survey it is shown that the kind of transitions made and the age at which these occur change.... The ages at which transitions in the demographic life-course are made, are compared for generations born after 1950. The results point to a continuous change. The only exception is the tendency to stay at the parents home, which changed direction towards a longer stay for those born since the mid 1960s." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
