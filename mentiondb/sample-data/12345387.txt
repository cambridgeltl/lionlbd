Willing to pay for family planning service. Indonesia.
This paper describes the case of a middle-class woman in Indonesia who travels 60 kilometers to receive family planning services instead of going to a locally-based private or public facility. She is a long-term IUD-using mother with children aged 18, 15, and 6 years who attends a private Yayasan Kusuma Buana (YKB) clinic in northern Jakarta. YKB is an independent nongovernmental organization (NGO) which promotes private sector involvement in urban family planning in Indonesia. Its 6 clinics served an estimated 9284 acceptors in 1993. Two clinics are self- sufficient, one is almost, and the rest should be within a few years. The case described reflects a trend in Indonesia of women increasingly seeking fee-based family planning services. While 20% of family planning acceptors now use family planning services provided by the private sector and NGOs in Indonesia, only 12% did so 6 years ago. Purely free family planning services are quickly disappearing in Indonesia. The National Family Planning Coordinating Board encourages this trend. Friendly and competent female midwives and support staff; short waiting times; the absence of sick and injured patients; bright and clean atmospheres; and affordable prices at YKB clinics attract and hold clients. YKB also promotes various community-based health programs such as the fee-charging school health program in Jakarta since 1987. Further, the organization has offered technical assistance to other private/NGO groups who wish to replicate similar programs elsewhere. The Executive Director notes in closing that maternal and child health services should account for an ever larger share of YKB services over time.
