A system for collecting vital statistics in Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
"This paper examines the four major sources of population data in the countries of the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) viz., general population censuses, registration statistics, household surveys and permanent registration of population. The paper starts with an analysis of the status quo of these sources in each country of the GCC, then proceeds to examine their standards of accuracy and finally identifies the problems faced by the data collection process in each source separately and states some practical solutions to them." The countries concerned are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
