"Our staff like to serve clients in a good and friendly way". An interview with YKB Executive Director Firman Lubis.
Yayasan Kusuma Buana (YKB) was established in Indonesia in 1980 to help promote an urban family planning program. Firman Lubis, Executive Director of the organization, responds to questions on the type of program originally planned; why fee-charging family planning services were introduced; the factors of successfully promoting fee-charging services; his views on the important ingredients of fee-charging service; his expectations of the staff who provide client-oriented service; why fees were charged for parasite control services; whether the control project was self-reliant; and why it has not been replicated in other municipalities. Lubis also discusses whether YKB plans to move toward other preventive health services; if the Tokyo Health Service Association will serve as a model for the YKB; public relations; staffing; training; salaries; popularity of the YKB family clinic; key issues for YKB; international donors; and the future of the organization.
