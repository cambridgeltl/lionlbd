A challenging example: fewer, safer abortions.
Although abortion on demand is available to Dutch women free of charge, the Netherlands has one of the lowest rates (5.6 abortions/1000 women of childbearing age) in the world. Abortion has become a back-up measure in cases of contraceptive failure rather than a form of fertility control. Over 75% of abortion seekers are regular contraceptive users. A recent survey of Dutch women of childbearing age indicated that, among those not desiring pregnancy, 25% were protected through sterilization, 45% used oral contraceptives, 13% used a barrier method, 10% had an IUD, 3% practiced natural family planning, and only 4% were non-contraceptors. Thus, efficient, widely accessible family planning programs fully supported by the Dutch government have substantially prevented unwanted pregnancy, thereby reducing the need for abortion. Also contributing to the effectiveness of contraceptive use among Dutch women has been a social climate that facilitates the open discussion of sexuality, with parents and peers. This climate eliminates the shame and guilt that might make young women apprehensive about approaching a physician for family planning services.
