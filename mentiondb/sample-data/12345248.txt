[The determinants of desired and completed fertility calculated using path analysis].
Recent fertility trends in Poland are examined using path analysis. "The...analysis confirmed that social and occupational affiliation causes variation in the number of children. Each social and occupational group transmits its accepted pattern of reproductive behaviour. The environment of an early socialization phase had a stable, though low influence on the existing number of children. The greatest indirect influence was exerted through education."
