[Family allowances as a factor of family assistance and population policy, 1948-1988].
The system of family allowances was introduced in Poland pursuant to a 1947 decree. There are 4 distinct subperiods in its evolution. During the period 1948-59, it was consolidated to become entrenched. In 1948, an allowance was paid for every child and nonworking spouse, and the revenue was raised from a 10-12% tax. In 1949, the respective allowances were boosted retroactively, and in 1953, a further raise was instituted. During 1956-59, real income grew measurably along with living costs. In 1959, regulations restricted entitlements, and the allowance/child stayed the same 70 zlotys until 1984 despite the fact that real wages grew eighteenfold to 16.838 zlotys from 1953-84. In 1953, the allowance for 2 children made up 15.7% of an average salary; in 1957, it decreased to 12.9%; and, in 1963, it declined to 9.9%. Appropriations grew by 10.4% because of the increase of claimants (by 25.4% with reference to wages). 42.7% of male claimants who received the allowance earned less than average vs. 77.1% of female recipients. There were 205 children/100 families who received the allowance. Except for the initial period, there was no population policy that regulated these allowances. 3,517,000 allowances were disbursed in the first half of 1949: 35.3% after the first child, 19.5% after the second child, 13.3% after the third child or more, 4.5% for a wife without children, and 27.4% for a wife with children. During 1956-83, those getting allowances for a child and wife dropped threefold, while those getting them for a wife only dropped from 11.2 to 1.9%. During 1962-73, the share of women increased from 17.7 to 30.1%. The majority of men who got aid had 3 children. The percentage of single heads of household was 6.9% in 1973 (91% women), 5.2% in 1981 (95% women), and 5.1% in 1985. In 1983, the disbursements with recompensation made up 6.9% of the state budget. This system is indispensable, especially for carrying out systematic economic reforms, albeit total outlays should be 2.7=2.8% of disposable GNP.
