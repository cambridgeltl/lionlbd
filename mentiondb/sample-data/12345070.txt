How much education?
"The paper examines trends in participation in higher education in Australia since the 1960s and key issues for the future provision of education. New developments, especially increases in the skill requirements of jobs and the decline in full-time employment opportunities for the young, have influenced trends during this period and have brought participation to a level that is high both in an historical context and in comparison with other countries. The paper discusses these developments and then focuses on the questions of whether there is a 'proper' level of participation, whether we should plan for a continuation of the upward trend in participation and the role of the Commonwealth Government in determining the quantum of enrolments."
