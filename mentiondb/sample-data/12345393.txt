Dissent to Senate Bill Nos. 846 and 847. Philippines.
The Institute for Social Studies and Action (ISSA), a nonprofit organization established in the Philippines in 1983 to address the health concerns of women and children, has expressed vigorous opposition to Senate Bills 846 and 847. These bills prohibit the use, production, sales or dispensation of abortive drugs and devices including oral contraceptives and prostaglandin, that have the potential to prevent implantation or interrupt pregnancy after implantation unless a physician has deemed their use necessary for physical indications. Violations are punishable by a fine and imprisonment of no less than 6 months. If they are physicians, violators lose their license to practice medicine; any foreign offenders are to be immediately deported. ISSA's opposition to these bills is based on 4 principles; 1) their violation of a woman's health and reproductive rights as protected by the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and Conference on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; 2) the misinformed use of abortion and contraception as symptoms; 3) a failure to consider the rights of women whose pregnancies result from rape, incest, prostitution, and psychological unpreparedness or from a lack of access to information about fertility control; and 4) the imposition of Catholic doctrine on an entire society, in violation of separation of church and state. ISSA is concerned that, if enacted, these bills will further increase the number of unwanted pregnancies and consequent unsafe, clandestine abortions.
