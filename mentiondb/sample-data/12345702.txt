Surgeons show success in early fistula repairs.
Though traditional practice has been to wait at least three months before repairing a vesico-vaginal fistula, consultant surgeon Kees Waldijk of the Kano and Katsina fistula hospitals in northern Nigeria reported success in repairing fistulae far less than three months old. Dr. Kees and his team carried out a prospective study of the effects of fistula repair on 170 patients who had had fistulae for less than three months. About 80% of the patients had fistulae that had leaked urine for 16-60 days at the time of repair. In 156 of the patients the fistula was closed successfully and 141 of them were continent. 15 still had incontinence (13 mild and 2 severe) but were expected to improve during the months after the operation. Of the 170 patients studied, 124 were treated without an anaesthetic. The more complicated cases were given a spinal anaesthetic. The procedure generally took about 20-25 minutes, and most patients walked out of the operating theater after the operation. Antibiotics were not given routinely to the patients, as fistulae are caused by decay of tissue, not by infection. A high protein diet and oral hematinics (iron and folic acid) are more valuable in this case than expensive antibiotics. The Kano and Katsina surgical teams have noted that fresh fistulae that are no more than 2 cm in diameter will heal themselves in more than half the cases where an internal catheter is inserted into the bladder. The two fistula hospitals serve a population of about 15 million. Kano has an objective of 1000 fistula repairs and Katsina shoots for 1500 repairs a year by 1996. Some 1.5-2.0 million women in Africa are estimated to have vesico-vaginal fistulae, and around 50,00-100,000 more are added each year. Fistulae can be prevented - by avoiding early childbearing and by access to skilled care during delivery for all women.
