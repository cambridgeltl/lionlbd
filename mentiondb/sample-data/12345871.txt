Oral contraceptives and drug interactions. Patient guide.
The author responds to questions about drug interactions with oral contraceptives (OC). Method failure can be caused by interactions between such contraceptives and other drugs, although the majority of OC failures involve factors in addition to drug interaction. The chance that even a significant drug interaction will lead to pregnancy remains under 5%. Drug interactions with OCs are, however, most frequently associated with anti-infective and anticonvulsant medications. Although the mechanisms behind such interactions remain a mystery, the resulting decreased effectiveness of OCs is thought to be related to the combined effects of the drugs on the liver enzymes and on the bacteria which normally live in the intestines. The author discusses how Rifampin, Griseofulvin, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Butabarbital, Carbamazepine, Ethosuximide, Mephobarbital, Ampicillin, Tetracycline, antihypertensives, theophylline, and caffeine may adversely affect the OC user. Anticoagulants such as heparin, aminocaproic acid, and troleandomycin should probably not be used at all with OCs. Regarding the alteration of drug dosages when used concurrently with OCs, dosages of imipramine, insulin, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide may need to be decreased because of the tendency of estrogen to reduce liver activity, while some diabetics may need to increase their dosage of insulin. There are no symptoms which would necessarily indicate a possible drug interaction involving OCs, so it is strongly recommended that individuals tell their physicians and dentists that they are using OCs.
