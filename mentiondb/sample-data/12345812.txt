The place of abortion care in safe motherhood programs.
This paper presents steps that safe motherhood programs can take to address the problem of unsafe abortion. The author discusses studies and training programs throughout the 1980s and 1990s in all regions of the world, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Kenya. Previous studies have shown abortion-related mortality in Africa to be extremely high, ranging from 20 to 80% of all maternal deaths. The author identifies 2 strategies for decreasing maternal mortality due to unsafe abortion: 1) improving abortion services by improving the treatment of abortion complications; decentralizing safe abortion services; and providing postabortion family planning services and 2) liberalizing the abortion law and removing or revising policies that restrict access to services, such as the uneven distribution of authorized providers in the urban, tertiary facilities; the restrictions on the types of providers who can perform the services; and the administrative requirements that must be met before the procedure can be performed (e.g., committee approval and multiple signatures from certified physicians). Based upon the high levels of maternal mortality because of unsafe abortion, the author concludes that safe motherhood programs have a responsibility to address this issue and to incorporate some of the suggested changes into their programs.
