Population profile of India: past, present and future.
India's 846.3 million people, who comprise 16% of the world population, inhabit just 2.4% of the total world area. India is the 2nd most populous country in the world. 74% of people live in 600,000 villages that follow traditional social and cultural practices. Population growth peaked during 1961-1981 at 2.2%/year. It began to fall slightly during 1981-1991 to 2.1%/year. Even though those younger than 15 years old comprise the largest population age group (39.6%), the group is decreasing (42% in 1971). India's dependency ratio is 0.9 for both children and the elderly and 0.8 for children alone. India has an excess number of males (929 females/1000 males), due largely to discrimination against females. Pregnancy and child birth are responsible for female death rates peaking at ages 15-29. Delayed marriages are more common than in the past (6.6% in 1981 and 19% in 1961). Most internal migration is from rural area to rural area (especially for females leaving their parents' home to go to that of their husband's) and rural area to urban area. Population density varies by state from 10 people/sq. km. to 6319 people/sq. km (mean = 267/sq. km.). Total fertility is 3.9 in rural areas and 2.7 in urban areas. 71% of births have a birth interval of less than 3 years. The 1985-1990 death rate in India compares to that of developed countries (9.8 vs. 10), but its infant mortality rate is still high (79 vs. 15). The population projections for 2001-2006 of the Standing Committee on Population Projections are 1003.1 million for population size, 23 for birth rate and 7.8 for death rate. It expects the population to stabilize (i.e., 0 growth rate) at 1.5 billion around 2080. This figure is much less than that of the World Bank's projection.
