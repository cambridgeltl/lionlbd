The other partner: the young man's role in adolescent pregnancy.
The US is the only developed country in which pregnancy among 15-19 year olds has increased in recent years. This study examines the relationship of contraceptive behavior, male gender-role conflict, and future-time perspective among black, white, and Hispanic unmarried adolescent fathers and non-fathers. 86 fathers and 92 non-fathers aged 14-21 years, mostly from New York City and surroundings communities, were sampled in questionnaires. Only six were aged 15 or younger. All participants used contraceptives inconsistently, with most sexually active males either using no contraception, using contraception inconsistently, or using methods known to be ineffective. Fathers did, however, report less consistent use of contraception than non-fathers. Fathers were fathers-by-accident, while non-fathers avoided becoming fathers by chance. Available data on contraception use within this population suggests that teenage males most often rely upon their partners to use a method such as the birth control pill. Further, adolescent fathers did not exhibit gender-role conflicts, suggesting that traditional male gender-role socialization may be more pervasive in our society than has been thought and may transcend differences in fatherhood status. Most adolescents in the present investigation scored on the high end of the scale on gender-role conflict in comparison to O'Neill's 1986 college student sample. Future-time perspective was the same for fathers and non-fathers, indicating that all adolescents may have similar abilities to perceive and plan for the future. The authors stress the need to encourage fathers to use contraception consistently to avoid additional unwanted, repeat pregnancies. Young men need to be encouraged to use contraception before they become sexually active and settle into patterns of high-risk sexual behavior.
