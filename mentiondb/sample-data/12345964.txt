Oral contraceptives and breast cancer: any relationship?
Oral contraceptives (OC) were first marketed in 1960, and have since been used by millions of women in the US. More is known about the safety and effectiveness of OCs than almost any other drug. It has been found that oral contraceptives protect against the development of ovarian and endometrial cancers, but the jury is still out on the relationship between OCs and breast cancer. Nearly all epidemiologic studies to date have found that breast cancer diagnoses at ages 20-54 years are the same for women who have and have not used OCs. Controversy remains, however, as to whether the risk varies by age at breast cancer diagnosis. The authors present an historic background, methodologic issues, recent epidemiologic findings, pregnancy analogy, and a section on seeking clinical relevance. They also reanalyze data from the 1983 Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study in the attempt to examine possible, age-specific differences in the relationship between OC use and breast cancer diagnosis. Almost 10,000 women aged 20-54 participated in the study. They conclude that available data clearly indicate that for women aged 20-54, overall breast cancer risk is unaffected by OC use. One can only speculate on whether using OCs reduces one's lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. The authors therefore recommend no change in prescribing practices or the use of OCs related to the risk of developing breast cancer.
