Socio-demographic structure of Sydney's perimetropolitan region.
"The paper conceptualizes processes driving change in perimetropolitan regions then, using Sydney [Australia] as a case study, analyses population growth rates and internal migration patterns between 1981 and 1991. Next, a set of social and demographic variables derived from the 1986 Census is analysed to derive four key dimensions of socio-spatial structure, namely: disadvantage, rurality, socio-economic status and retirement."
