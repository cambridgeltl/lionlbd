Future contraceptive methods.
Contraceptive development in the US over the past two decades has been seriously hampered by regulatory issues, political pressures, and legal concerns. Researchers primarily outside of the US, however, are continuing to work on improving existing methods and developing new ones. In particular, AIDS has renewed interest in barrier methods to prevent the transmission of HIV, the underlying agent of AIDS. Female-controlled barrier methods and agents with virucidal and microbicidal properties are sorely needed. This article provides an overview of some contraceptive methods on the market in other countries, but not available in the US, modifications to existing methods which are under investigation, and new methods of contraception on the horizon. After the opening section on the climate for contraceptive development, the paper examines contraception for female use under the following headings: hormonal implants; biodegradable implants; biodegradable norethindrone pellets; biodegradable injectable norethindrone microspheres; transdermal contraceptives; vaginal rings; injectables; IUDs; female barrier methods such as spermicides, the PROTECTAID sponge, disposable diaphragms, and Lea's Shield and FemCap; and permanent chemical and reversible forms of sterilization. For men, testosterone injections, progestin-androgen combinations, peptide hormones, polyurethane and Kraton condoms of comparatively more headroom, permanent and reversible sterilization, drugs and plant compounds, nifedipine, and contraceptive vaccines are considered.
