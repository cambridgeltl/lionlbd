Contraceptive vaccines. Birth-control vaccine feasible, but more work needed.
This report summarizes a birth-control vaccine clinical trial study performed in India. The vaccine's mode of action is to neutralize human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). By neutralizing HCG, a fertilized egg cannot become attached to the uterine wall and will be passed during the woman's subsequent menstrual cycle. Chorionic gonadotropic hormone also stimulates the production of estrogen and progesterone, which are vital to maintaining a pregnancy. In a 7-year chronic toxicity study, monkeys were hyperimmunized with an HCG analogous vaccine. No significant damage to any organ or organ system was found. The bioneutralization level of HCG antibody in that study was reported to be greater than 50 ng/ml. The vaccine schedule involved three primary injections at 6-week intervals followed with a booster to maintain the needed HCG antibody titer. In this trial, 162 women were enrolled, but only 148 finished the vaccine regime. Of these, all women developed HCG antibodies at titer levels of at least 50 ng/ml. One pregnancy was reported from this group out of a recorded 1224 total menstrual cycles. The author concluded that this study demonstrated the feasibility of the contraceptive vaccine approach to birth control, but he also stated that further research is needed before fielding a more practical vaccine.
