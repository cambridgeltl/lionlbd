[Family and migration strategies in the Senegal basin].
A comparison of migration patterns among the Soninke and Toucouleur ethnic groups that inhabit the Senegal river region is presented using data from a 1991-1992 survey of 3,400 rural families. "The differences primarily regard the duration and the destination in their migration patterns. Those differences are then analyzed according to family's subsistence strategies and multi-level activity as well as the system of social relationships which develop between the emigrant and his/her family or community of origin."
