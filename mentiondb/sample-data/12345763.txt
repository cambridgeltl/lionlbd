Ten-year population education programme reaps good results.
A study, which was undertaken by the National Education Committee to determine differences in knowledge and behavior regarding population issues between those who had taken population education courses from 1981-1986 at Tai An No. 1 Middle School and those who had graduated in 1983 and 1984 without the benefit of population education from Tai An No. 4 Middle School, demonstrated that those students exposed to population education in 1983 and 1984 had better knowledge on population issues, and married and began producing children later than the others. 26.1% of those who attended population courses in 1983, and 13.3% of those who attended in 1984, married. In comparison, 66.7% of those who did not attend population courses in 1983, and 53.3% of those who did not attend in 1984, married. Population education was introduced at Tai An No. 1 Middle School in 1981; the forms it has taken include curriculum development, teaching programmes, examinations, social investigations, knowledge competitions, research and thesis writing, and after-class activities. Teaching methodologies have included lecture and practicum, audio-visual aids, discussion, self-learning methods, and social investigations. Since 1980, 5391 students from 94 classes in the first term of grade 2 in senior level have received population education. Results of examinations indicate that a large majority of these students perform well in terms of knowledge and attitude and have a better understanding of the interrelationships among population problems, environmental and ecological balance, and economic and social development. Social investigations and community visits have strengthened the commitment and social responsibility of the students, who form a voluntary propaganda team for the government's population programme. The Tai An No. 1 Middle School has also used an exhibit hall for population education of the public.
