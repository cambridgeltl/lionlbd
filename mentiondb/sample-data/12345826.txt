Family planning gains ground even as comprehensive health care reform effort falters.
Neither House of the US Congress passed health care reform legislation before September 1994, but they may yet pass a small-scale incremental package. It is doubtful that such a package will bring about a major overhaul of the health care system. The collapse of comprehensive reform occurred despite major progress in the last 12 months in coverage of family planning services and treatment of family planning providers. The debates over health care reform have put family planning services and agencies into the mainstream, which was not done during earlier political debates. Just 1 of 5 health care reform bills proposed before Clinton became president included family planning services. All the proposed bills since Clinton took office included family planning services in the mandated benefits package. They even recognized the importance of family planning clinics at the community level. Traditional health insurance does not cover family planning adequately (e.g., 50% of typical policies do not cover reversible contraceptives), probably because it is considered preventive care.
