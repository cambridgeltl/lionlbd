The effect of hypertonic saline on human corneal hydration.
Hydrophilic gel contact lenses, presoaked in various strength saline solutions, were held in intimate contact with the in vivo human cornea. A change in corneal water content was observed taking place against the induced osmotic gradient. Direct stimulation of some aspect of the mechanisms controlling corneal hydration is postulated, in a manner which may be similar to that previously reported for the in vitro rabbit cornea.
