BCG vaccination.
The practical elements of BCG vaccination in neonates are used in most developing countries are outlined. The World Health Organization that all neonates be vaccinated, as well as all unvaccinated children when they present for health care, without prior PPD testing. BCG vaccine is a live attenuated TB vaccine in lyophilized state, so it must be kept cold and away from light. After redissolving, the vaccine is given intradermally with a 0.45% 10 mm needle either on the volar left forearm or the posterior left arm, at a consistent site in each country. The dose must be 0.05 ml for babies 1 year old, and 0.1 ml for older children. A wheal is formed that disappears in 30 minutes, followed by a red nodule in 3-4 weeks. The depressed scar is evidence of vaccination. In rare cases, lymphadenitis may appear, sometimes with a fistula. This is more likely when 0,1 ml is given to infants, the vaccine is not diluted properly, or the injection is given too deeply. While immunodeficiency is considered a contraindication for BCG vaccination, infants born to HIV-positive mothers have received it without adverse effects. Other immunizations such as oral polio may be given concomitantly. Verification of BCG vaccination is by presence of the scar or PPD testing. About 30-50% of children entering school are still positive; negative children may be revaccinated.
