An investigation into the methods of mortality indexing using the data from China's fourth population census.
In 1990, China conducted its fourth population census. The data will play a major role in China's national plan for economic and social development. The intention is to explore how the census data can be used to determine mortality indices by studying population mortality. The fourth census required reporting of the number of deaths in households from January 1, 1989, to June 30, 1990, in three time periods: the first half of 1989, the second half of 1989, and the first half of 1990. The key to the study of population mortality is to determine the age-specific mortality index for calculating another index such as either the age-specific average mortality rate or the age-specific mortality probability. Six different methods and 10% sample data from the 1990 national population census were used to obtain several national population mortality indices. Regarding the various mortality indices, methods 1 and 2 are extremely close, and 3-5 are relatively close. Methods 1 and 2 used the population mortality figure for the year 1989 in the census, whereas methods 3-5 used the population mortality figures for the second half of 1989 and the first half of 1990, and method 6 used only the population mortality figure for the fist half of 1990. From the mortality figure reports for the first half of 1989 to the first half of 1990 obtained from the sample, in the first half of 1989 there were 321,336, in the second half of 1989 there were 325,113, and in 1990 there were 376,568. Thus population mortality was 1.18% greater in the first half of 1989 than the second half of 1989, and the number of mortalities in the first half of 1990 was 15.83% greater than the second half of 1989, and 17.19% greater than the first half of 1989. Such great discrepancies in the reported mortality figures can only be explained by underreporting.
