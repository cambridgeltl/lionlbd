Women's rights abused by lack of health care.
According to "Human Rights in Relation to Women's Health", a report commissioned by the World Health Organization and written a Rebecca J. Cook, governments are failing to protect women's rights because proper health services for women are lacking, and customs that damage the health of women are allowed. This is due to the low status of women. 500,000 women die annually from causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. This is accepted in some societies as the natural order of things. Risk factors include abortion of the female fetus, female genital mutilation, early marriage leading to early pregnancy, poor nutrition, lack of education, domestic accidents, heavy and dangerous work, too many pregnancies in too short a period, lack of family planning services and information, and abuse from men. Governments, in order to fulfill human rights treaty obligations guaranteeing proper health care without sex discrimination, must meet an international standard of care. Education and legislation are necessary to change customs and to provide services. The report was presented at the United Nations Conference on Human Rights in June, 1993, in Vienna, Australia.
