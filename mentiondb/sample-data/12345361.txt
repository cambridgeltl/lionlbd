Japan: seeds of consciousness.
Historically, women's bodies in Japan have been viewed as tools to support larger national populations. Men remain emotionally and physically in control sexual relations. Women are deprived of adequate information to exert control over their bodies and fertility. Health and welfare policies view women's sexuality strictly in terms of marriage and motherhood; the reproductive health needs of unmarried women are ignored. There are no clinics where women can receive information about sexuality or contraception, despite the existence since 1952 of a national family planning program. Abortion remains the predominant form of birth control since oral contraceptives are not available and diaphragms and IUDs are difficult to obtain. Japanese women are beginning to organize for gender, reproductive, and sexual rights, but traditional attitudes remain a barrier. If Japanese women are to control their own bodies, they must first understand them through access to sex education. Clinics should be established where women can obtain information, counseling and services on sex, abortion, and contraception.
