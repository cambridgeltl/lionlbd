[Probability of grandparenthood not down yet].
Cohort fertility data for the Netherlands are examined to determine the probability of becoming a grandparent. "According to the 1935 and 1965 parity distributions...84% of the generation born in the 1930's will have at least one grandchild.... The average number of grandchildren is calculated to be 4.7....A woman's first grandchild is born when she is 54, on average. If higher birth order children are also considered this age is six years higher." (SUMMARY IN ENG)
