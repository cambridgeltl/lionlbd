An Algerian experiment: short chemotherapy for tuberculosis.
427 Algerian children aged up to 15 years were treated at the Pediatric Clinic of the Beni-Messour University Hospital Centre, Algiers, between July 1979-January 1985 with a 6-month multi-drug course for tuberculosis (TB). TB was diagnoses by clinical and x-ray findings in 56% and confirmed bacteriologically in the rest. Those with pulmonary, meningeal, osteoarticular, or renal TB received isoniazid and rifampicin daily for 6 months with streptomycin and pyrazinamide for the first 2 months. Those with primary TB, regional lymphadenitis, pleural, peritoneal, or other localized TB received the same drug regimen without initial streptomycin. 372 children completed the course, and, of these, all were cured, 99% definitely so. There were 3 relapses. Children who did not complete the drug treatment included 7 who died due to TB, 4 of them pulmonary and 3 meningeal; 1 who had drug toxicity; 17 who stopped treatment and were lost to follow-up; 30 who were lost to follow-up after completion of treatment and 5 who died of unrelated causes. The only adverse reactions were transient elevated liver transaminase in 4.6, and 1 case of jaundice in a child who received an accidental overdose. Besides its effectiveness, this short course treatment was considered beneficial because only 4% discontinued and were lost to follow-up, compared to 15% of a prior group given a 12-month treatment course.
