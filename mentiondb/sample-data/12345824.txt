WHO links female genital mutilation to maternal health problems.
In April 1994, female genital mutilation was discussed at a briefing session at WHO's Global Commission on Women's Health which met during the World Health Assembly. Female genital mutilation is associated with pain, infections, and health accidents which in turn adversely affects the physical and psychosocial health of women and girls. More than 80 million girls and women in more than 30 countries have suffered from female genital mutilation. At the meeting, WHO's Director-General pointed out that human behaviors and cultural values have a purpose and satisfy a function for people who practice them. So people will adopt new behaviors only if they are as meaningful and effective as the old behaviors. Parents will not allow female genital mutilation once they realize that avoiding such a practice is in their daughter's best interests (i.e., better health, a successful socioeconomic future). Health professionals must propose changes in a fashion that have meaning to the people and correspond to their own social, cultural, and economic environments.
