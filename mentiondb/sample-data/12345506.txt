The structure of South Africa's health service.
The South African health system is a combination of the private sector based on the free market model mainly serving the rich and of primary health care (PHC) predominating in the homelands. It is physician and curative care-centered. Authority and service delivery are divided between the national health department, 4 provincial health departments, and many local authority health departments. These 3 levels rarely coordinate efforts. The national health department conducts no planning or evaluations. After South Africa left the Commonwealth, it nationalized the missionary health services that had served the poor. They were then redistributed to the homelands, which, due to low budgets, had to stress preventive care and provided basic curative care. A single, unified management ran these integrated services, setting the framework for PHC. A new government, a coalition government of national unity, should emerge in South Africa in late April 1994. The African National Congress (ANC) is expected to gain the most votes. ANC and the National Party (NP), the current ruling political party, have many areas in which they agree, e.g., commitment to PHC. They both believe that the government should move towards a single integrated ministry of health. The ANC and NP do not expect increases in the health budget. The two parties differ in how to finance health care. The ANC wants the public sector to expand, while the NP wants it to shrink. The ANC aims for universal health care regardless of ability to pay, for which the government would be responsible. The ANC wants to create a clear health system structure with district, regional, and national levels. It calls for health services to be accountable to the community and to include the community in decision-making. The ANC wants a national essential drugs policy, while the NP does not.
