Basic needs in rural El Salvador.
590 family health promoters work with the Salvadoran Demographic Association (ADS) to bring health care and family planning services to communities and individuals in need throughout the rural areas of El Salvador. In the 592 communities served by the association in 1992, family planning services and primary health care were promoted and provided to mothers and children, with cases needing major attention being referred to ADS's network of 38 reference doctors and clinics, or to public health centers. The promoters have potential family planning acceptors complete a detailed questionnaire to best determine which method of contraception is most appropriate and which, if any, may be contraindicated. The author describes the case of one such promoter of family health who is a certified midwife, a rural paramedic, a community leader, an health care volunteer, and a rural distributor of contraceptives working with ADS for the past ten years. She spends four hours every day wandering around searching for people in need of family planning, but have no access to contraception.
