Focus of population conference is turning to women.
The empowerment of women is emerging as a central theme at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. A representative of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, Roxanna Carrillo, notes, "For the first time, the United Nations and the world is now working with women. Every single population policy in the last 30 years has failed because it wasn't done with participation of women." Concern has been expressed, however, that this emphasis on women's issues will shift attention from broader population issues and alienate participants from male-dominated Third World countries. Muslim Fundamentalists, for example, believe that all family planning decisions should be made by the husband. Even if a women's agenda is adopted, female delegates face the task of ensuring that governments follow though on its implementation.
