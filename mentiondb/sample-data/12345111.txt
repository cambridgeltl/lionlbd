Philippines launches new bid to slow population.
The Philippine Government on August 2, 1993, set out to strengthen the family planning program in a bid to check the rapid population growth rate of about 2.4%. The Philippine population of 66.5 million is the 14th largest in the world. President Fidel Ramos said that the Government's family planning program is based on freedom of choice. In a strong call for checking the country's population growth, he rejected arguments by the Catholic church that birth control was an issue of religious faith. The ESCAP Committee on Poverty Alleviation through Economic Growth and Social Development was scheduled to hold its 1st session in Bangkok on September 20-24, 1993, along with an expert group meeting also at Bangkok on September 15-17, on the topic of national poverty concepts and measurements. From 30 September 30 to October 2, 1993, an expert group meeting on the environment and sustainable development will be held at the ESCAP secretariat. Mortality was involved in children living in poverty and mothers suffering ill health from giving birth to too many children, President Ramos said, and added that the increasing population has placed the welfare of the people and the future of the country at stake. He said that he was determined to reduce the population growth rate to less than 2% by the end of his term in office in 1998. Earlier, at a conference on population and economic development sponsored by the Asian Development Bank in mid-July, 1993, the Economic Planning Secretary warned that unless runaway population growth was checked, it would be nearly impossible for the Philippines to eliminate poverty or generate economic growth.
