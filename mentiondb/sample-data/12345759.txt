Recent trends in contraceptive use.
Using data from the World Fertility Survey (WFS) and the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), this article provides a global overview of levels and trends in contraceptive use. The discussion is accompanied by figures showing 1) the total fertility rate by contraceptive prevalence in 104 countries and 2) regional trends in the percentage of married women of reproductive age currently using contraception for developing countries. Tabulated data are also provided on 1) the regional average prevalence of specific contraceptive methods, 2) the percentage of married women of reproductive age currently using contraception by country and region, 3) recent trends in contraceptive prevalence in developing countries which have data available from two or more surveys, 4) a summary of annual average increase in contraceptive prevalence in less developed countries by region and by prevalence at earlier survey, 5) the change in the prevalence of use of selected contraceptive methods, 6) trends in contraceptive prevalence between the WFS and DHS by urban and rural residence, and 7) the same trends by woman's education. Analysis of these data reveal that about 53% of couples worldwide are using contraception (48% in developing and 71% in developed countries). About 80% of contraceptive use in developing countries is accounted for by sterilization, IUDs, and oral contraceptives. In nearly two-thirds of the developing countries where trends can be measured, contraceptive prevalence has been increasing by 1-2 percentage points per year. Urban residence resulted in prevalence 20 percentage points higher than rural residence, and highly educated women average around 30 percentage points higher use. These differentials changed very little over the decade for which data were available. Thus, the pace of future fertility decline will depend upon the growth of contraceptive practice among less educated and rural women.
