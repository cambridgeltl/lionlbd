Biotelemetric investigation of the regulation of the cardiac frequency in animals with use of telestimulation. Model examinations in the neat.
A method for the assessment of behaviour of the cardiac frequency regulation in freely moving animals by means of telestimulation and biotelemetry is described. The results of the examinations allow, in spite of individual variability, a classification of the animals into different types of regulation by consideration of the biorhythm. The assessment of the individual type of regulation in correlation to the biorhythmic structure of the organism is of basic significance for the evaluation of its capacity of performance and adapation.
