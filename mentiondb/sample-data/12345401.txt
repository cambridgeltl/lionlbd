International Women's Day address.
The government of the National Resistance Movement of Uganda has consistently supported the socioeconomic and political development of women. Thus, women participate in politics right from the village committees to the National Resistance Council. Women are saluted for initiating community efforts through the Safe Motherhood programme. In Uganda, life expectancy is estimated at 53 years, the crude death rate at 20 deaths per 1000 people, the infant mortality rate at 110 deaths per 1000, and the under-five child mortality rate at 180/1000 live births. During the 1960s, malaria had been brought under control, and the majority of the population had access to good quality medical care. The political turmoil and economic decline of the 1970s and early 1980s grossly affected health delivery. Government health expenditure declined from 5.3% of the budget in 1972 to 4.3% in 1983. In the rehabilitation strategy, the share of the health sector rose to 8% of the FY 1992/93 budget. The Ministry of Health facilities can cover only 30% of the population. 50% of the annual deaths are caused by preventable diseases: malaria causes 15% of the deaths and diarrhea another 8.7%. High fertility rates, coupled with inadequate maternal and child health care, are responsible for a large part of female morbidity and mortality. The maternal mortality rate is estimated at 500 per 100,000 live births, mainly resulting from hemorrhage, infections, obstructed labor, and abortion. Only 26% of the women deliver in health institutions, 23% use traditional birth attendants, and 51% give birth at home. 18.4% of children under 5 years are moderately malnourished. Health workers should educate expecting and nursing mothers on child and maternal nutrition. In rural areas about 20% and in urban areas about 50% have access to safe water. To provide clean and safe water needs the co-operation of communities and non-governmental organizations. Women are involved in developmental activities through non-governmental organizations and various women's groups such as the National Association of Women's Organizations of Uganda.
