[Types of the demographic transition in the countries of Europe].
23 European countries were studies on the basis of statistical manuals from individual countries, the INED manual from France, demographic publications of the UN, and the proceedings of the 1974 International Population Conference held in Bucharest. The countries were classified according to duration of demographic transition 70-80, 80-90, 90-100, and 100 years; characteristics of the length of demographic transition (very short, short, average long, very long); the occurrence (peak) and intensity of demographic explosion (the coefficient of natural growth per thousand, 12, 12-14, 14-16. and 16 years); and the characteristics of demographic explosion (very weak, weak, average, strong). Based on these criteria, 7 types of demographic transition were identified. Type 1 was characterized by a very long transition period, 100 years, where demographic explosion took place during 1855-85, and the coefficient of natural growth stayed 14-16 per thousand. France, Norway, Sweden, and Great Britain belong here. Type 2 also exhibited a long transition period (almost 100 years). The explosion occurred during 1895-1910 with a natural increase of 14-16 per thousand. Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Germany (from 1946 GDR and GFR) belong here. Type 3 is represented by Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland with an 80-90 year transition and 12 per thousand natural growth by the end of the 19th century. Type 4 is typified by Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Italy. The transition lasted 80-90 years, but the explosion took place twice: during 1895-1915 and 1920-35. Natural increase stayed 12 per thousand. Type 5 included Greece, Yugoslavia, and Portugal. Transition lasted 80-90 years, and the demographic explosion took place during 1925-35 with natural increase of 12-14 per thousand. Type 6 was represented by Bulgaria, Poland and Romania. The transition was short, 70-80 years. Explosion occurred during 1895-1915 and 1920-35 with a very high natural growth of 16 per thousand. Type 7 was exemplified only by Austria and Hungary, with a very short transition (about 65 years); while a demographic explosion was observed during 1895-1910, natural increase stayed 12 per thousand. The process was longer (90-140 years) in countries where transition started before 1870 than after this data (65-85 years). Significant differences were observed between countries of the northwest and countries of the south east.
