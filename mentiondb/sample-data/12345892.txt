Africa issues "common position" on environment.
At a meeting on November 13-14, 1991, in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, African Ministers of the Environment and of Development and other senior government officials from 45 countries adopted the "African Common Position on Environment and Development." This position paper, to be presented at the 1992 UN Conference on the Environment and Development, emphasized that developmental and environmental concerns are inextricably linked in Africa and that development strategies in the future should emphasize economic growth through poverty alleviation and environmental protection. The legitimate right of African countries to exploit their natural resources for development purposes was forwarded in the "Abidjan Declaration." In order for Africa to safeguard its environment, the financial aid of the international community will be required. Whereas the group urged that a "recycling of debt" be undertaken to divert funds into local environmental protection efforts, they also urged that the adoption of environmental programs not be seen as a precondition for financing other areas of development.
