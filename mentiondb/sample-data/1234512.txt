Criteria of quality and methods of measurement in multichannel biotelemetry.
In contrast with one-channel biotelemetry, multichannel biotelemetry systems permit the analysis of biological systems by means of cybernetics. Some simple examples are given. The basic concept of a multichannel system is described. The criteria of quality of which the nonevident ones are defined by detailing the test circuits are the following (input criteria): number of channels, bandwidth, voltage range, impedance, maximum voltage outside the signal band, stability of the power supply for transducers, factor of safety against multipath propagation, distance between transmitter and receiver, shock, vibration and temperature range, weight, volume and operating time. Output criteria: signal-to-noise ratio, linearity, crosstalk transfer function, different time lags.
