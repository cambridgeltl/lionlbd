[The French state and immigration: problems involved in implementing a public policy].
The author uses the example of France to examine why it is so difficult for a liberal democratic state to control immigration. He examines the political process in France, particularly the capacity of the government to intervene in matters of social and economic activity. Even though France is seen as a strong, centralized state with the capacity to intervene when it needs to do so, the author concludes that "economic and social conditions are found to play a much greater role in channeling migratory flows than the 'actions' of the state, as expressed in public policy."
