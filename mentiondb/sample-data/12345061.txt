Mortality in Poland in the period 1950-1990.
"In this paper, crude, specific [mortality] rates as well as nonstandardized and standardized indices of regional mortality differentials are analysed [for Poland] for the period 1950-1990, in order to show mortality differentiation, its increase by age, sex, and place of residence. Taking into account cause specific death rates, the pattern of causes of deaths was found to be similar to that existing in the western countries, although the level of standardized mortality is higher in Poland. Values of calculated indices of regional mortality differentials point to significant differences in mortality by voivodship."
