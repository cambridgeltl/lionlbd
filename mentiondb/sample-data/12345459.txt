Lesotho's referral hospital measures maternal deaths.
Dr. N. Tlale and Dr. G.F. van Doorn analysed maternal death data from hospital records in order to improve the quality of care at Queen Elizabeth II Hospital in Maseru, Lesotho. Greater than 50% of the maternal deaths in 1992 were due to sepsis and toxemia. 11 of the 21 women who died were 15-24 years of age; 6 were 25-34; and 4 were 35-44. 10 were having their first child. One died before delivery; 5, during delivery; 13, after delivery; and 2, after unsafe abortion. These 21 women represent a hospital maternal mortality ratio of 413 per 100,000 live births. Although a high proportion of maternal deaths were women having their first child, 9 of these women were referred after complications had started elsewhere. The goal of the Safe Motherhood program in Lesotho, which should begin at the end of 1993, is to ensure that women receive care in a timely manner. Program activities will include: 1) informing the communities of the signs and symptoms of pregnancy complications; 2) improving links between remote health centers and district hospitals; and 3) developing training materials for health personnel in regard to obstetric emergencies.
