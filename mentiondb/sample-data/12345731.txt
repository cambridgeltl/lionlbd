The paradox of progress.
During the last 25 years, the number of people, worldwide, seeking family planning services has increased. Due to the efforts of national governments, international donor agencies, and volunteer organizations, more of these people are able to fulfill their needs. Between the early 1960s and 1990, in developing countries, the percentage of couples practicing family planning rose from 10% to more than 50%. However, research indicates that there is still a large need for information and services among clients. This need will increase if international efforts are not intensified. Global spending on family programs will have to double; international donor aid will have to quadruple; and the percentage of development aid spent on population activities will have to increase from 1% to 4%. Since the rate of acceptance of family planning has been faster than the rate of expansion of services, a paradox of increasing success and growing need has occurred. A concerted international effort is required to remedy this situation. Providing more services is insufficient; quality services that are acceptable to clients, particularly women, are needed, as are programs designed for marginalized populations (refugees, and persons living in occupied territories, remote rural areas, or poor conditions).
