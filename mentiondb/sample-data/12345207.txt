Sex, drugs and HIV control.
The need to take a broader approach against AIDS was emphasized at the 1993 international conference on AIDS. Individual behavior is affected by social, political, and economic forces and is the result of much more than individual choice. For example, a participant at the conference described how economic pressures have prompted the government of Zimbabwe to introduce school fees. Families, however, are also short on funds and prefer to educate their boys over their female offspring. Female school enrollment is therefore declining despite the merits of education in improving women's economic independence and ability to negotiate safer sex. Policy needs to be changes to favor delivering education and health care where it is needed, but this may be especially difficult to secure for target groups often shunned by the general population such as IV drug users and prostitutes. Steps must be taken to both prevent HIV infection and provide AZT treatment where necessary, regardless of financial constraints. Also speculation exists regarding the potential curative effects of treating AIDS with Kemron. 1993 results from a controlled trial, however, showed that people with AIDS symptoms demonstrated no detectable benefits from treatment with Kemron. Finally, the report notes that AIDS ACTION was redesigned in response to a questionnaire and discussions with readers in different countries.
