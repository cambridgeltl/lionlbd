Having its own strength.
More than 100 million couples throughout the world want to stop or postpone childbearing, but they have neither the quality family planning information nor services that they need. This situation has arisen because demand for fertility control has grown more rapidly than the supply of affordable family planning services. The number of women aged 15-49 will increase by 140 million over the period 1994-2000, while the contraceptive prevalence rate increases concurrently, causing the number of women protected from unintended pregnancy to increase from 489 million to 685 million by 2000. This additional growth in demand will only make it more difficult to provide quality family planning information and services to people in need, especially in developing countries. Home governments and consumers bear most of the costs for family planning, paying 78.8% in 1990, with foreign donors paying the rest. Many family planning programs in developing countries, however, are seriously underfunded. Traditional donors have been asked to increase the quantity of population and family planning assistance they render, but the economic slump in the industrialized countries may preclude the receipt of additional funds. One of the most promising and practical plans is to promote South-South cooperation advocated by the Non-Aligned Movement countries. Developing countries have the appropriate technical knowhow and can share their program-relevant experiences in developing and implementing programs. Efforts are already being made to transfer the related technology and to provide technical assistance, with the Japanese government already providing US 700,000 to Indonesia for cooperation in family planning.
