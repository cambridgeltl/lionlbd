A clinico-epidemiological study of pyogenic meningitis in children.
The study was conducted among the inpatients of the pediatric ward of J.N. Medical College Hospital, Aligarh Muslim University in India, from January 1989 to December 1991, to determine the etiological factors and the prevalence of pyogenic meningitis. Personal and family histories were recorded. Of 8168 patients admitted to the pediatric ward during the study period; 226 (2.73%) had pyogenic meningitis. 48.23% were under 3 years old, 17.73% were 9-14 years old. A male predominance (male to female ratio = 1.89 : 1) was observed. 67.94% of patients with pyogenic meningitis were urban dwellers, 71.05% lived in overcrowded conditions, and 82.75% belonged to large families. Seasonal variation of pyogenic meningitis was also noted with the peak (58.25%) in winter months. Mothers of 57.96% patients with pyogenic meningitis were illiterate. Proportional mortality was 3.7%. Maximum cerebrospinal fever rate (CFR) was noted in children under 3 years old (41.79% in males and 45.23% in females), belonging to large families (38.09%), those with illiterate mothers (49.01%), and those residing in rural areas (48.82%). CFR was highest (52.82%) among the patients who had to travel more than 10 km to reach the hospital and who were hospitalized 6-9 days after the onset of symptoms (52.45%). Since younger people are at risk of developing meningitis, health care services should also integrate facilities for early diagnosis and treatment of pyogenic meningitis, with an ambulance available at the primary health center level.
