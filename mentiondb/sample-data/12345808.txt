Size of Pakistan government AIDS grant criticized.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that there are between 20,000 and 50,000 HIV cases in Pakistan. Although the country's AIDS Prevention and Control Program was initiated in 1987, it is only being pursued aggressively now after being integrated with the overall health care system. Critics have stated that Pakistan has no program to screen HIV high-risk groups. The biggest challenge before the government is to educate people about AIDS and its consequences. This task is, however, complex in a conservative Islamic country which has a 40% national literacy rate, 67% rural population, and where sex is not openly discussed. Health officials are planning to involve the Islamic clergy to disseminate information about HIV/AIDS through sermons in the mosques. However, it is not yet known if the idea will be accepted by the clergy. Experts warn that urgent steps need to be taken to prevent the HIV situation from developing into an advanced epidemic.
