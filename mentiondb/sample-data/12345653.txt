A growing challenge: addressing "unmet need".
Even though family planning programs in recent decades have helped increase the level of contraceptive use among married women in less developed countries to an overall rate of 50%, an enormous number of people are still denied the good quality contraceptive services which they want and need. Approximately 20% of fecund women in union who want to avoid becoming pregnant, 120 million women, are not using contraception. Unmet need for contraception is also high among sexually active and single teenagers, people who already use one method but are dissatisfied with that method, people who have access to only one or two methods, and men. Demographic data suggest that half of women in low prevalence countries lack knowledge about contraceptives or have religious reservations about using them, while in countries of high contraceptive prevalence, health concerns are the major reason for nonuse, followed by infrequent sex, and lack of knowledge. Family planning programs are seeking new ways to address the unmet need for contraceptive services variously among married women, men, adolescents, refugees, and those who turn to abortion because of poor access to contraceptives. Quality care is called for when providing such services. Postpartum women, serving rural areas, involving men, and tomorrow's parents are discussed.
