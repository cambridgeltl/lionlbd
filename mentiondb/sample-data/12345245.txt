The baby boom of the late 1980s: life course of a post-World War II cohort.
"This study examines the 1980 surge in birthrates in the context of the life course of women of the post-World War II baby boom. It attempts to describe in more exact detail the role of these women in the 1980 baby boom. Additionally, the study contends that historical time, social time, and life time all have influence on the timing of their reproductive decisions. The data are compiled from reports issued by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the Population Reference Bureau. Some attitudinal data are obtained from the 1988 General Social Survey."
