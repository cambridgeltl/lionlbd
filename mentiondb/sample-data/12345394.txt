Needs assessment.
The Senior Program Assistant of the UNFPA Jakarta Office comments how Yayasan Kusuma Buana (YKB), an independent nongovernmental organization, has helped bring access to family planning and maternal and child health care to the urban poor in Indonesia. She finds the clinics to provide quality, client-oriented services at relatively modest fees. The services are provided in a comfortable, home-like atmosphere. The author first came into contact with YKB when the UNFPA was helping the National Family Planning Coordinating Board conduct a 12-city needs assessment for adolescent reproductive health care. She notes that findings from the study will help policymakers and concerned health situation. Findings suggest that clinic costs must be kept as low as possible without sacrificing service quality and that clinics must be relevant and responsive to the community with regard to its fee structure so that they do not price themselves out of the market.
