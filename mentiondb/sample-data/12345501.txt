[The effective growth of the population as a factor of regional social and economic activity and living conditions].
"The author analyses changes in location of the Polish population in the years 1989-1991. From the analysis it appears...that the role of the Warszawa, Lodz, Wroclaw, Krakow and Legnica voivodeships in the process of population concentration is decreasing, and...the role of Western, Northern and South-Eastern regions [is increasing].... It is difficult to say how much [current changes are] due to economic transformations and how much to the crisis in local economies." (SUMMARY IN ENG AND RUS)
