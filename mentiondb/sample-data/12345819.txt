First regional conference highlights key OR findings in Africa.
In October 1993 in Nairobi, Kenya, The Population Council's Africa OR/TA Project sponsored the international End-of-Project Conference which concentrated on the successes in family planning service delivery during the Africa OR/TA Project I. For example, family planning and maternal and child health services were integrated in Kinshasa, Zaire, resulting in increased contraceptive use over 4 months (3-43%). The conference aimed to promote utilization of operations research (OR) findings to strengthen family planning service delivery in Africa, to communicate major findings from completed OR project studies, to review OR methods and procedures, and to deliberate future directions for family planning OR in Africa. Conference components included plenary sessions, panel presentations, working group discussions, and a poster session. The Director of the Africa OR/TA Project addressed 3 sources of data that challenge the weak demand hypothesis for contraceptive prevalence in Africa: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Situation Analysis, and OR. DHS findings show a large total demand for family planning services and that the proportion of this demand met by family planning services is rather low in most countries. Situations analysis and OR studies reveal major weaknesses in the supply of services influencing the programs' abilities to meet demand. They also show that when services are improved and easily accessible, many people use family planning. Sub-Saharan Africa is witnessing a decline in fertility rates (e.g., Kenya, 8.3-6.6; Zimbabwe, 6.5-5.5; Botswana, 6.5-5). OR will be instrumental in helping governments and service delivery agents identify effective, culturally sensitive, and economically viable approaches to important issues facing health and family planning programs.
