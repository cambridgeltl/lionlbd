Communities and AIDS prevention: what works.
The HIV/AIDS pandemic demands that public health workers aggressively interact with communities, especially those which are hard to reach, to disseminate appropriate and effective prevention messages. Reaching entire communities with consistent messages is particularly important because experience shows that individual behavioral change cannot be sustained unless it is supported by a social environment which encourages healthful behaviors. Four approaches to community-level change have been found to be effective: outreach, community mobilization, diffusion of innovation, and social marketing. Each approach is discussed in turn. They all use community members as educators, outreach workers, leaders, and distributors of condoms. They differ, however, in the manner which their respective peer leaders function and what they do. Many programs may combine elements of more than one approach to community-level change.
