Policy regulation and demographic behaviour. Romanian population policy and its consequences.
The effect of population policy in Romania up to 1989 is discussed. The author finds that "Romania's population policy up to 1989, for which any contraceptive method was illegal and punished, and where as a consequence there was a severe control of information regarding family planning,...had a real and very important impact on attitudes and behaviour...[and] on health, especially on that of women and children." Data on deaths from illegal abortion, maternal mortality, and child abandonment are presented.
