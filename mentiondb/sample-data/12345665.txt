Young people first.
More than 50% of the world's population is less than 25 years old, with one in three people aged 10-24. In many countries, more than 50% of the population has unprotected penetrative sex before the age of 16. Under these circumstances, more than 50% of people infected with HIV are under age 25, with young women far more likely to be HIV-infected than men. Pubescent and post-pubescent youths undergo a host of normal physiological and psychological changes which cause them to desire sexual intercourse and take risks. Some have even more to cope with due to their being in poverty, homeless, unemployed, discriminated against for their homosexuality, and/or subject to violence. With limited access to information about sex and sexual development, and no access to counseling or sympathetic family planning services and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, adolescents produce many unwanted pregnancies and contract myriad STDs. An urgent need therefore exists to enable young people to protect themselves against HIV, other STDs, and unwanted pregnancy, and experience safe and healthy sexual development. Appropriate interventions include providing sex education in schools, working with youths in religious organizations, sports or youth clubs, using the media, and making family planning services more accessible. Whichever approach is taken, however, it is imperative that young people be understood, accommodated, and involved; that they be conferred the necessary skills, attitudes, and information; that they have access to services and sympathetic and knowledgeable adults; and that supportive environments be fostered.
