How to use the diaphragm.
A diaphragm is a dome-shaped soft rubber cup with a flexible rim which when correctly fitted and inserted into the vagina of a woman protects her from unwanted pregnancy and some sexually transmitted diseases. Its ability to prevent the male-female transmission of HIV, however, is unknown. Available with the prescription of an health care provider who will ensure that the correct size is provided, diaphragms cover the cervix and are held securely in place behind the pubic bone and the rear wall of the vagina, thus preventing pregnancy by blocking the entry of sperm into the cervical canal. The device also holds a spermicidal jelly or cream which kills sperm which may manage to swim around the rim of the diaphragm. A diaphragm may be inserted up to six hours before intercourse and must be used at each coitus to prevent pregnancy. The woman should urinate and wash her hands before inserting the diaphragm. A limited amount of spermicide should then be placed in the cup and around the edge of the device. The woman then holds the diaphragm dome facing down, presses the opposite sides of the rim together between the thumb and third finger, and pushes it in as far as it will go along the rear wall of the vagina until it is locked in place just above the pubic bone. During insertion, the woman may stand with one leg up, squat, or lie down with legs flexed as she sees fit. The diaphragm should then be left in the vagina for at least six hours after intercourse and removed soon thereafter. Simply tug behind the front rim with one's index finger to remove the device. The diaphragm is then washed with mild soap and water, and stored in a cool, dry place until next use.
