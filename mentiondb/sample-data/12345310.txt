Amphotericin B lipid complex available for AIDS related cryptococcal meningitis. South Africa.
Amphotericin B is generally considered to be the standard treatment against candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis, and aspergillosis. The potential side effects of kidney toxicity and anemia, however, limit its use. Amphotericin B has therefore been incorporated into a lipid complex and clinical results thus far suggest that this ensemble may significantly reduce the risk of toxicity while maintaining or increasing drug efficacy. This modified version of amphotericin B (ABLC) is available on a compassionate use basis in the US and Europe for patients with life-threatening systemic fungal infections for whom currently marketed drugs are ineffective or too toxic. 250 patients have thus far been treated with ABLC under the compassionate use program; several hundred more have received it in controlled clinical trials; and additional large US phase 3 trials are being planned. The Liposome Company, Inc., of Princeton, New Jersey, has initiated named patient distribution of ABLC in the Republic of South Africa. 2 patients with cryptococcal meningitis have thus far received it. Cryptococcal meningitis is a type of fungal infection occurring in up to 10% of patients with AIDS; 20% of patients die within 30 days of diagnosis. The chairman and CEO of Liposome argues that getting the drug to AIDS patients in South Africa will help the company accumulate data quickly on the drug's efficacy and safety. The company is also working upon an application to get ABLC approved for use in Europe.
