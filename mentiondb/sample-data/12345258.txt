[Logistic effects in the two-sex model with "harmonic mean" fertility function].
"In the present paper the effects of the presence of logistic terms in [a] two-sex random mating model with 'harmonic mean' fertility function are discussed. The behaviour of the model is studied by means of a phase plane analysis. It [is] possible to show the existence, under quite natural conditions, of one (and only one) meaningful equilibrium point that is globally stable. This equilibrium is the final result of an adjustment process [and includes an]...initial period during which it is possible to observe a preliminary balancing process of the sex composition...."
