Family planning strategy for the 1990s in Tunisia.
The government of Tunisia has pursued a reduction in population growth through provision of family planning services since 1966. The services are provided by the Ministry of Health; however, most activities are managed by the National Office for the Family and Population (ONFP), a semi-autonomous agency of the Ministry of Public Health. The 1988 Demographic and Health Survey showed a total fertility rate of 4.3 per woman and a growth rate of 2.4 per annum. The contraceptive prevalence rate was 50%; 40% were effective modern methods. During the 1990s, the government plans to continue its commitment to population and family planning programs, which is reflected in its allocation of budgetary resources to ONFP (73% of direct costs and nearly 90% of overall costs in 1990). However, ONFP will become a coordinator of services provided through the marketplace and paid for by the consumer. The role of the private sector in provision of services will greatly increase. Family planning will be integrated into basic health care services of the Ministry of Public Health and into other education and social service programs administered by other government ministries.
