In vivo effects of angiotensin antagonists on plasma aldosterone in the dog.
The effects of infusions of equimolar doses of Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II and of Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II on plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity and arterial blood pressure were compared in normal dogs. Plasma aldosterone increased significantly after Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II whereas it was unaffected by Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II. Changes in blood pressure and renin activity were small without marked differences between both groups of animals. The experiments demonstrate a clear steroidogenic potency of Sar1-Ile8-angiotensin II. Therefore, Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II should be preferred as antagonist of the action of angiotensin II in the adrenal gland.
