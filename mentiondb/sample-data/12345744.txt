The concept of unmet need.
The definition of "unmet need" for contraception (married women who are not using a contraceptive method, are fecund, and do not wish to have any more children) has been extended to include married women who want to postpone another birth for at least 2 years as well as pregnant or amenorrheic women if no contraception was used and the pregnancy occurred earlier than desired or after the last wanted birth. The shortcomings of this definition include the fact that it ignores never-married sexually-active young women, it fails to take abortion into account, and it ignores men altogether. Considerations based on effectiveness of methods and the quality of services would be better left to other measures. Another criticism is that the measure of unmet need overestimates the potential decline of fertility that would be realized if need were met. Thus, the measure of unmet need has different meanings for different investigators. The primary use of the measure has been to provide program administrators with information about the magnitude and characteristics of their market. The measure also provides data on the potential demographic significance of satisfying the demand for contraception. Finally, it is important to remember that not all women with unmet need are ready to use modern contraceptives. Thus, satisfying unmet need also includes an informational and educational effort. It is also important to remember that rapid population growth may cause an increase in the actual number of women in need even though the corresponding percentage decreases.
