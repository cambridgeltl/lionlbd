Pro-choice and Catholic. PPFA's new leader charts a new course.
Pamela J. Maraldo, newly appointed president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), believes her pro-family planning, pro-choice stance is consistent with her identity as a practicing Catholic. In her new position, Maraldo hopes to initiate a dialogue with Church leaders to advocate for a continuation of traditional Catholic values--compassion for the vulnerable, tolerance of others, and moral responsibility to the world--can continue to thrive in modern times. The majority of US Catholics share Maraldo's views. 79% agree that Catholics should be able to make their own decisions about family planning and abortion; only 13% agree with the Church hierarchy's position that abortion should be illegal under all circumstances. With pro-choice, pro-family planning politicians now in power, PPFA expects to be able to devote more attention to expanding sex education in American schools, removing all financial and geographic barriers to voluntary contraception and abortion services, increasing pubic and private sector investment in contraceptive research and development, and instituting health care reforms focused on prevention, universal coverage for all reproductive health services, and guaranteed reimbursement of non-physician providers.
