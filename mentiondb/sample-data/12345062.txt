Epidemiological evaluation of death risk from cardiovascular diseases among Polish population of working age.
"The aim of the study was an evaluation of death risk among men and women of working age exposed to cardiovascular risk factors. The survey covered random samples of the population living in the regions of Wroclaw and Ciechanow, [Poland,] including families of all who died from cardiovascular diseases in 1988.... The results of demographic analyses [indicate] that social factors exerting a negative effect on health behaviours are responsible for high mortality in males. Moreover, difficulties of Polish life place additional stress on male population.... For each from among 18 analysed factors the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases was several times higher in exposed males than in females."
