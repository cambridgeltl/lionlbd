Governments urged to integrate environmental and population concerns in development planning.
Governments were asked to coordinate their policies and programs regarding development, population, and environment and to take into account demographic trends and patterns of production and consumption by the UN Expert Group Meeting on Population, Environment, and Development (New York, January 20-24, 1992). The meeting urged developed countries to make technologies, which were designed to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development, available to developing countries at a reasonable cost. International organizations were advised to increase their assistance in the fields of population, sustainable development, and environment. Governments were encouraged to undertake projects that were ecologically beneficial and labor intensive (reforestation, contour leveling, terracing small scale irrigation); to enhance the access of the rural poor to employment opportunities, credit, and social services (health, education, and family planning); to place emphasis on popular education, especially for women; to provide additional resources to local authorities for city management, particularly those experiencing rapid population growth; to provide adequate training in municipal management, including provisional environmental services; and to emphasize the participation of women as environmental managers in community-based population and environmental programs.
