[Mortality and health in African towns].
An analysis of current conditions concerning health and mortality in the towns and cities of Sub-Saharan Africa is presented. The authors first examine mortality differentials between rural and urban areas and their causes. They next look at intra-urban mortality differentials and health issues in general by considering health practices, malaria, and AIDS. They use these three approaches to sum up the consequences of the current urban health crisis in Africa and to assess the health status of urban residents in general.
