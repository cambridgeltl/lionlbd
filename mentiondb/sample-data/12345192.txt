Impact of changes in China's urban mortality on the average life expectancy.
The differences and changes in gender-specific and age-specific mortality during the periods of 1973-1989 were analyzed based on changes in average live expectancy (ALE) and disease-induced mortality among China's urban population during 1973-1989. The data were obtained from the Center of Health Statistics and Information, Ministry of Public Health. During 1973-1980, ALE at birth increased from 69.0 to 70.70 among men and from 70.26 to 73.34 among women. During 1980-1989, ALE at birth grew to 71.77 among men and 75.62 among women. The difference in ALE in birth between men and women increased from 1.26 years in 1973 to 3.85 years in 1989. The increase in ALE during 1973-1989 was caused mainly by the decline of mortality in each age group below the age of 15. During 1980-1989, the drop of mortality in the age groups of 45 and above substantially affected the increase of ALE. The increase of ALE prior to 1980 was caused mainly by the decline of mortality from respiratory (particularly pneumonia among lower age groups) and infectious diseases, and the increase during 1980-1989 was attributed to the drop of mortality caused by cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases (particularly chronic bronchitis among the middle-aged and elderly population). Among women, mortality caused by malignant tumors dropped (e.g., cervical cancer). The decline of mortality caused by cerebrovascular diseases in the 1980s accounted for 36.8% of the increase in ALE among men and women, respectively, during 1980-1989. The increase in mortality among men caused by malignant tumor reduced the increase in their ALE during 1980-1989 by -30.8%, mostly among the population above the age of 45, and among men in particular. The increase in ALE among the urban population will further slow down, mainly because of the decrease in mortality from chronic diseases (cerebrovascular diseases and senile chronic bronchitis) among the middle-aged and elderly population.
