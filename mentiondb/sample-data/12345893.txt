Zimbabwe takes action to involve males in family planning.
The Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC), in order to increase the involvement of males in family planning, conducted a 36-month Male Motivation Project, with the assistance of the Johns Hopkins University Population Communication Services. The goals of the project were to increase knowledge of family planning methods among men of reproductive age; to improve men's attitudes toward family planning; to increase the use of modern family planning methods among men and their sexual partners; and to promote joint decision-making, regarding family planning, between men and their partners. To achieve these objectives, a drama series with family planning messages played for 6 months on entertainment radio; motivational and educational talks were conducted by male ZNFPC workers in mines, farms, factories, and villages; and pamphlets on family planning and contraceptive methods, aimed at men, were distributed. This occurred during 1989; at the end of the year, an evaluation survey was conducted. About 97% of the men knew about the pill and the condom, and 92% indicated approval of family planning. 2 out of 3 currently married men indicated they had ever-used a modern, female-dependent method (usually, the pill) with their wives; 61% indicated they were using one at present. Of the married men using a family planning method, 64% were using it for spacing births, while 29% were using it for limiting family size. Approximately 41% of the men thought men alone should decide the number of children to have; 45% thought both men and women should be involved in the decision.
