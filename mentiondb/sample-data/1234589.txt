[A new technic for determination of antibiotics in the renal parenchyma].
The determination of antibiotics in the renal tissue is of real value only if the blood and the residue urine are removed from the kidney. The Authors report a new technique dealing with the washing of the organ "in situ" by means of an artery-vein perfusion succeeded by the sucking of the residue urine from the ureter. The experiments were carried on male albino rats with the following antibiotics: indanylcarbenicillin, tobramycin, fosfomycin and cefazolin.
