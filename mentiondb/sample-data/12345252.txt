Male and female fertility: a comparison of age-specific and cohort fertility of both sexes in Germany.
Data from German sample surveys was used to compare male and female fertility by birth cohort from 1902-04 to 1959-61. The results indicated that prior to 1930 male fertility was higher, and there was a wide range between male and female fertility. The gap narrowed over time among males aged over 40 years, whose mortality declined markedly over time. There were differences in male and female completed fertility for all age cohorts. The war years had an effect on the sex ratio, and the result was a reduced number of births. The marriage market when there was a surplus of male partners yielded a smaller share of childless women and a larger number of births. Factors affecting reproductive potential were the age difference between spouses, the length of the reproductive life span, the sex ratio, male migration, cohort size, and female survivorship. Male and female models can never separately adequately explain true population development. Cohort estimates showed female fertility peaks for cohorts 1950-52 at 15-19 years, 1944-46 at 20-24 years, 1932-40 at 25-29 years, and 1932-34 at 30-34 years. Between 1965 and 1970 there was a baby boom. Completed fertility for cohorts declined from the early 1900s. Male fertility for all cohorts showed smaller rates for men aged under 25 years and larger rates above age 30 years compared to women. Age specific fertility rates for men for all cohorts fluctuated like female rates. Before 1928, men had more children. The decline in male fertility rates at ages 35-39 years ended at cohorts 1938-40. A declining trend in male cohort fertility was evident for all periods for men aged over 40 years. The 1902-04 cohort for men aged over 40 years was about five times as high as female fertility. By the 1929 cohort male and female fertility differences were minimal. Even when the sex ratio was in equilibrium cohort fertility of males and females may be different because not all people reproduce. The share of childlessness within cohorts depends on the scarcity of one sex, such as was evidenced in the shortage of males after 1945.
