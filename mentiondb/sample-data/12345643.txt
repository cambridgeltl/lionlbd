Policy and HIV / AIDS prevention: lessons learned.
The Brazilian government, per pre-AIDS epidemic era economic policy, maintained until recently a 15% import tax on condoms. This policy made condoms too expensive for most people who needed them. In response, AIDS prevention activists in 1993 and 1994 launched an intensive information and advocacy campaign to convince policy makers that a supply of affordable condoms was crucial to slow the spread of HIV in Brazil; the tax was withdrawn in April 1994. This experience of AIDS in Brazil highlights the important role of policies in HIV/AIDS prevention and the influence advocates have over them. The responses of governments, business, and religious and nongovernmental organizations to the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the past decade have yielded important lessons about the creation of effective prevention policies. For example, it has been learned that policy often lags behind the HIV/AIDS epidemic, knowledge about HIV and AIDS among policy makers is often limited and inaccurate, women face the greatest impact from AIDS, HIV/AIDS prevention efforts must compete with other priorities for limited resources, comparative examples can influence and guide policy formulation, local prevention efforts too rarely inform the policy process, and prevention in the workplace is often neglected.
