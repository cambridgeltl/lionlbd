Distribution of lifetime income allowing for varying mortality rates among women, men, blacks, and whites.
The author investigates income distribution according to gender and race differences in mortality rates in the United States. "This study merges economic and epidemiological literatures. A more extensive application of the Paglin (1975) life cycle hypothesis is proposed. Not only are adjustments made for varying ages, they are also made for varying survival probabilities from one age to the next. Finally, some consideration is also given to the implications of varying morbidity rates across race and gender for the distribution of economic well-being."
