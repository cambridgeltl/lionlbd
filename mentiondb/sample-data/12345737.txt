Taking services to refugees in Ghana.
A year after refugees from Liberia began arriving in Ghana in 1990, the National Council on Women and Development arranged a meeting to discuss the introduction of family planning (FP) services to the refugees who were increasingly concerned about an increase in adolescent pregnancies and worried about the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV infection. The Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG) agreed to provide reproductive health education and nonclinical contraceptives. By 1993, the PPAG built a clinic at the camp in order to offer clinical services to the refugees. Settlers soon became well informed about FP, but only 56 clients used contraceptives. By 1993, this figure increased to 120 with a further 217 obtaining FP supplies from pharmacies. 149 women used oral contraceptives, 110 used injectable contraceptives, and 140 used condoms. The project is currently expanding to deal with STDs and women with infertility problems. In 1994, efforts to involve men will intensify through the formation of "Daddies' clubs" and through the use of men as community-based distributors.
