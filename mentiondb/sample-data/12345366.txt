Sexuality counselling in India.
The Family Planning Association of India's Sex Education, Counseling, Research Training/Therapy (SECRT) project is spearheading the incorporation of sex education into its family planning activities. SECRT has trained health professionals, teachers, and peer youth leaders in counseling skills. To overcome resistance to the introduction of sex education into school curricula, parent-teacher meetings throughout India were addressed. Pamphlets, books, charts, workshop proceedings, and audiovisual aids have been produced. There are 25 core trainers and 50 volunteers who work out of SECRT centers in 11 states. When the government launched an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention program in 1990, SECRT was already positioned to initiate peer counseling on this issue. The project's focus is on educated urban youth aged 15-29 years--a sector that will become India's future parents and leaders, but has been neglected by the government and voluntary organizations.
