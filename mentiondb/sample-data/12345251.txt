The elderly and international migration in Canada: 1971-1986.
"This paper addresses issues of elderly immigrants in Canada within two areas: their characteristics as immigrants and their contribution to the social phenomenon of the aging of the Canadian population. The patterns of net immigration of persons aged 60 years and over are identified according to sex, age and place of origin of immigrants.... Emigration of this group is studied separately. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the elderly immigrant population displays migration patterns significantly different from that of the total immigrant population. Older immigrants participate even more extensively than their younger counterparts in the process of remigration or return migration. As a consequence, an increase of the proportion of older immigrants...does not necessarily accelerate the aging of the Canadian population." (SUMMARY IN ITA)
