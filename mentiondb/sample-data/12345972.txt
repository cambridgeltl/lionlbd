"Poverty, pollution, population" -- a new form of dynamite.
Dr. Huguette Labelle, President of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), during the World Health Organization (WHO) Task Force on Health and Development, warned that poverty, environmental degradation, and population growth are forming a new kind of dynamite that threatens the world. The Task Force, which was held in December 1994, met to formulate a draft declaration for the World Summit for Social Development, which will convene in Copenhagen in April 1995. WHO wants to integrate protection and promotion of quality of life with economic growth. Reproductive health was one of the topics of the 3-day meeting. Poverty, unemployment, and social disintegration were considered to be linked in a vicious circle. The summit will require national and international commitments to actions that will alleviate poverty and adverse social conditions caused by economic policies and growth, and to measures that support social development, including reproductive health and family planning services.
