[The Europe of migration: at the crossroads].
The author reviews migration to and among the countries of Europe. Following a brief overview of trends since 1945, the focus is on comparisons between 1981 and 1990. The impact of migrants from the third world is compared with that of Eastern European immigrants, and the influence of the formation of the European Community is assessed.
