The final Preparatory Committee meeting for the International Conference on Population and Development, held in New York in April 1994, raised concerns about the likelihood of emerging from Cairo with a Plan of Action that would address the reproductive health needs of women. As a result of opposition from the Vatican and Muslim fundamentalists, all references to issues such as safe abortion and family planning services for adolescents in the draft Plan of Action have been placed in brackets. Since conference decisions are based on a vote rather than consensus, it is hoped that the brackets will be removed and the Cairo gathering will result in a new global approach to population.
