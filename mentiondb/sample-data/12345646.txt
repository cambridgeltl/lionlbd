"Empowering" women.
Healthcare providers and policymakers have been confused by suggestions that empowering women will help them to practice family planning. Two experts on women's health stress that empowerment is a process rather than a single event and should be considered as such when exploring the relationship between women's empowerment and women's use of family planning. Empowerment is a series of steps by which individuals gain access to critical economic and educational resources such as information, assets, cash, and skills. These resources are then used to bring about environmental change and influence other persons and institutions with competing or conflicting interests. Empowerment should be viewed as a process in which all voices are encouraged to be heard for the ultimate goal of securing mutually beneficial solutions. Spouses, partners, and mothers-in-law often make decisions for women on contraceptive choice and use. Women also may not have the money needed to pay for desired and needed family planning and health services. The relationship between empowerment and women's use of family planning is therefore complex and problematic. Comprehensive reproductive health programs, however, help empower women as a result of their ability to transform power relations within the family, community, and society, and challenge female subordination. The authors note that researchers in exploring the relationship between family planning, reproductive health, and empowerment may want to consider the political, economic, and household dimensions of women's lives. It is also noted that results from at least one study suggest that work alone may not be a vehicle for women's empowerment.
