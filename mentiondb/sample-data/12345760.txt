A decade of change in contraceptive behaviour in Latin America: a multivariate decomposition analysis.
This study relies heavily on World Fertility Survey and Demographic and Health Surveys data to examine recent trends and determinants of contraceptive use in five Latin American countries: Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. These countries experienced a substantial increase in contraceptive prevalence in the inter-survey period. Within countries, however, the increase was not equally shared by all social and demographic groups. The study found that relatively disadvantaged groups experienced greater gains in contraceptive use. Despite the prevailing tendency towards convergence, wide differentials in contraceptive behavior among social sectors still persist. A decomposition analysis based on logistic regression revealed that certain shifts in the population composition--i.e., increased proportion of urban and better educated women and a growing proportion of mothers who want to discontinue child-bearing--contributed substantially to the aggregate increase in contraceptive prevalence in most countries. Structural changes, understood as changes in the relations between the explanatory variables and the likelihood of using contraception, were also found to play a significant role in contraceptive use trends, particularly in Colombia.
