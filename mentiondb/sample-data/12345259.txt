Comparative analysis of death cause diversity curves in various countries.
"We used diversity indices to quantify the dominance conditions of death cause frequencies [in England, Finland, Hungary, Japan, and Norway]. Plotting age-diversity values, the curves exhibit large changes in the death cause diversity/concentration by age.... The differences are mostly attributed to the site and value of the characteristic maximum. In both studied sections (Neoplasms and Circulatory Diseases) the Japan diversity curves differ considerably from corresponding curves of the European countries. Characteristic departures are observable between the diversity graphs of the male and female groups." (SUMMARY IN ITA)
