AIDSCAP: reaching communities through local organizations.
More than 100 community-based private voluntary organizations and nongovernmental organizations in more than 30 developing countries carry out 70% of the activities funded by the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) AIDS Control and Prevention Project (AIDSCAP). This reflects USAID's wish to capitalize on both the ability of community-based organizations to reach diverse populations and the years of experience these organizations have in working in their communities. By improving local technical and managerial capabilities, AIDSCAP is acting on its belief that containment of the AIDS epidemic depends upon the grassroots prevention efforts of community groups. One of the AIDSCAP-funded projects in Tanzania has trained more than 6000 peer educators who have reached more than 60,000 members of trade unions. In Brazil, one of the AIDSCAP-supported efforts has resulted in the training of 227 peer educators who have provided prevention information to more than 40,000 men who have sex with men. AIDSCAP is collaborating with the Red Cross, the Pharmacists' Association, Planned Parenthood, World Vision, and government agencies in Thailand and is improving the ability of a consortium of 40 NGOs to disseminate information and advocate for policy changes.
