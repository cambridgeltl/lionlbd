Some improvement but not enough, say experts.
While there seems to have been a slight drop in the risks of pregnancy in Sub-Saharan French-speaking countries since safe motherhood programs got under way, the number of maternal deaths has gone up because there are now more births, according to a group of African health experts who met in Burundi in April 1993. Some 42,000 women in French-speaking countries of Sub-Saharan Africa die of the complications of pregnancy and childbirth each year. The group of francophone African experts on safe motherhood was formed after the 1989 conference in Niamey, Niger, when government representatives from French-speaking countries of Africa pledged to reduce maternal mortality by half by the end of the century. But in their 1993 meeting report (entitled "Safe Motherhood in Francophone Africa: Some Improvement but Not Enough) the experts asserted that lack of political commitment in addressing maternal and women's health issues as a national priority was one of the reasons why programs were not effective. Safe motherhood activities should be integrated into the national health strategy. Training should be adapted to address women's health problems sensitively to women's needs. And safe motherhood programs will be more effective if they are planned and carried out in consultation with health professionals and community leaders. Participants called for adequate monitoring and evaluation of safe motherhood programs and better health education for the whole community. Some maternal health and family planning programs exclude adolescents, yet teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortion are rising. The group, which is supported by a World Bank trust fund, includes experts from Benin, Burundi, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal, and Zaire.
