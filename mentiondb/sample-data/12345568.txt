Humanae Vitae and education for chastity.
In order to teach children to live chaste lives, their parents must also be living in accordance with the tenets expressed in the Pope's "Humanae Vitae." Periodic continence from sexual intercourse affords tranquility and peace to married life and allows parents to have a deeper influence on the education of their children. Living according to the encyclical promotes a reverence for life; it enhances communication in the family and allows children to witness a stable marriage. In addition to supporting the vocation to a stable marriage, the encyclical also promotes the ability of the family to nourish religious vocations in the children. The encyclical also reiterates the rights of parents to provide sex education to their children at home instead of surrendering this right to other institutions. Sex education (or, preferably, education for chastity) must be positive (and not reduce everything to biology), prudent and clear (holding moral values), and delicate (rather than explicit). By mid- to late-adolescence, young people should know that natural ways of spacing children are available, but they do not need to have the extensive counseling afforded to engaged couples. "Humanae Vitae" presents a bridge across the generations in family life which provides hope for the future.
