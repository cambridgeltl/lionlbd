Is Cytotec an answer?
Brazilian women's reliance on Cytotec--a prostaglandin commercially marketed for the treatment of gastric ulcers but with abortifacient potential--demonstrates the depth of determination of poor women to control their fertility in countries where abortion is illegal. An estimated 1-4 million clandestine abortions are performed in Brazil each year. After Cytotec's introduction in 1986, sales rose rapidly to 50,000 units/month by 1991. In 1991, however, the Ministry of Health altered the regulations surrounding sales of Cytotec. Its sale was prohibited in 1 state, its use was restricted to hospitals in another, and the remaining states required 2 prescriptions. As a result, sales dropped to 5000 units/month in 1992. At the time these restrictions were enacted, Cytotec was the agent used to introduce half the abortions induced by Brazilian women. Women found this method acceptable because of its low cost, accessibility, and privacy. The major complication of its use, uterine bleeding, is far easier to treat than the uterine perforation and pelvic infections associated with other methods of self-induced abortion. In fact, the improved abortion-related mortality/morbidity statistics in Brazil in recent years are probably a direct result of Cytotec use. Restricted access to this agent is expected to reverse this trend.
