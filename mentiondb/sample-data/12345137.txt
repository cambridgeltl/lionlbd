National Family Health Survey.
The authors outline the organization and administration of India's National Family Health Survey, for which data collection was scheduled for completion in June 1993. Data analysis and survey objectives are discussed, as well as some political factors affecting data collection. It is noted that "the National Family Health Survey is...a large-scale sample survey covering 97 per cent of the population and involving more than 90,500 households.... Another feature of the NFHS is its uniformity in questionnaire design, sample design, data collection and analysis. This uniformity provides an opportunity for inter-state comparison."
