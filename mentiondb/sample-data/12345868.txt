Population data for local development.
Planning and decision making at the local and regional levels involve using data concerning the distribution of population and other variables over space. The authors in this paper discuss population data applied to local development with exclusive focus upon developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). A growing number of LAC countries are realizing that efforts to achieve sustainable social and economic development require decentralization of their societies with effective local capabilities for participation, planning, and decision making. This realization is in turn stimulating many in the countries to look for and adopt relevant technological and methodological advances in the field of information. In their discussion, the authors discuss numerical versus bibliographical data, the development strategy and information access, the census as the major source of small-area population microdata, and the emergence of new information needs and associated technology. This latter section is subdivided under the headings of geography, multidisciplinary databases, hiding R+ and GIS inside windows applications, and the institutionalization of technology and data transfer.
