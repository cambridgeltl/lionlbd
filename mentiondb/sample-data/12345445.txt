The EVALUATION Project promotes consensus on family planning quality indicators.
Between April 1992 and March 1993, the USAID-sponsored Evaluation Project's Service Delivery Working Group (SDWG) met to develop family planning (FP) program performance and impact indicators for use in evaluating FP programs. After extensive review of the work of an earlier subcommittee, the SDWG devised a core list of indicators categorized according to the 6 elements of the Bruce Framework on Quality of Care: 1) choice of method, 2) informing and counseling clients, 3) technical competence, 4) interpersonal relations, 5) mechanisms to ensure continuity, and 6) appropriateness/acceptability of services. The SDWG also identified outcome measures and proposed data collection methods for each indicator. The list of quality indicators was initially intended for use in clinic-based services, but it has been adapted for use in community-based distribution and social marketing programs. The indicators are being subjected to international field tests with the list adapted to the needs of ongoing projects. International experience in the application of these indicators will be reviewed at an Evaluation Project meeting in late 1994. At this time, an attempt will be made to reduce the list to the most essential service quality indicators. The Evaluation Project would like to learn about any field applications of the indicators and to share the indicators list with interested individuals. The contact person for this Project is Dr. Jane Bertrand, Tulane University, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, 1501 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112; fax: 504-584-3653.
