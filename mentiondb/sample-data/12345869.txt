Global POPIN Coordinating Committee meets at Cairo.
The POPIN Coordinating Committee met in Cairo from August 31 to September 1, 1994, immediately before the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). The meeting was held to review the progress of POPIN activities at the regional and global levels, to promote coordination of information activities in the various regions, and to draft recommendations for POPIN activities and the role of the Global POPIN Coordinating Unit in 1995 and beyond. Highlights of meeting proceedings and of subsequent discussions with coordinating committee members are presented. Recommendations were made with respect to each of the following issues in the interest of improving information sharing and coordination in and among regional commissions and POPIN networks: long-term strategy, POPIN advisory and coordinating committees, promoting the use of modern information technologies, publicity and promotion, follow-up on the ICPD, the collection and dissemination of documents presented at major population conferences, and regional POPIN networks. Profiles are presented of regional POPINs in sections on the Economic Commission for Africa, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Europe, and the Association for Population/Family Planning Libraries and Information Centers.
