In Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics, maternal deaths become more common.
Maternal mortality is becoming more common in Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, reflecting a decline in women's health because of economic and maternity care problems. Women are vulnerable to the economic and social disruption in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. A recent conference organized by the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe addressed women's health in these countries. The gap between the health of women in the former socialist countries and those in the rest of Europe seems to be widening. A woman in Turkmenistan can expect to live 10 years less than a woman in the European Union. In Lithuania and Poland, female life expectancy fell during the early 1990s. Maternal mortality in the newly independent states is twice as high as in Central and Eastern Europe and four times higher than in Western Europe. Although maternal mortality in Albania and Romania fell dramatically after abortion was legalized a few years ago, levels are still well above the average for Europe. The risk of pregnancy-related death is increasing in Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, and St. Petersburg, some of it on account of better reporting systems. However, increases in maternal death are also the result of deteriorating socioeconomic conditions, inadequate health systems, and use of abortion rather than contraception to regulate fertility. The role of midwives is severely limited; newborn babies are separated from their mothers; information about treatment options is lacking; and financial costs of health care are growing.
