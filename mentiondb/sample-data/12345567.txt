Responding to the needs of people.
Social policy reform based on human development rather than on economic adjustment is gaining widespread acceptance as a major goal for the 1990s. It is no longer enough to find a new balance between affordability, growing needs, and basic social justice, radically different ways of making and implementing social development decisions are required. During the 1980s, governments had to adjust social contracts in order to manage public resources more efficiently. Social programs which had historically brought the politically disenfranchised one of their few advantages were reduced or eliminated because they were considered too costly. In fact, economic solutions to social reform and development have not worked; economic disparity is greater today than ever before, with the richest 20% of the world benefiting from 150 times the income of the poorest 20%. The new theoretical approach demanded by this situation will rely heavily on cross-sectoral planning, identifying target groups, and prioritizing needs. The collapse of the East-West ideological divide resulted in a market-driven, interconnected world in which developing countries must improve international competitiveness, adapt to rapid technological changes, and accommodate production systems to external, rather than internal, demands. The social challenges faced by developing countries are exacerbated by the fact that developing countries have yet to find the appropriate development paradigm for the next century. Also, past development efforts have not fully responded to individual and community needs or to cultural values and capabilities. In order to place the needs of people at the center of a development policy which is driven by social rather than economic concerns, new forms of government must evolve which emphasize democratization, greater fiscal accountability, decentralization, privatization, and local initiative.
