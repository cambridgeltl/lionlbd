Summary statement presented by the Consultative Meeting to the International Society of Quality Assurance, Maastricht, the Netherlands, June 1993.
The Consultative Meeting on Quality Assurance in Developing Countries held in the Netherlands in June 1993 resulted in 10 recommendations. 1) Quality assurance programs (QAPs) and related activities should be strengthened or initiated in all countries to provide accountability and feedback for professionals, legislatures, and financial bodies. 2) QAPs should include appropriate central and peripheral-level mechanisms to allow integration with existing activities, and QAPs should receive adequate funding. 3) QAPs should set communication standards and should monitor, evaluate, and improve quality. 4) QAPs should provide incentives and motivation for broad-based community participation. 5) QAPs should focus on technical quality, community satisfaction, professional satisfaction of providers, and the quality of management support services. 6) QAPs should be applied to all types of public and private health care in a flexible manner. 7) QAPs should incorporate the tenets of quality management such as focusing on the client, encouraging self-determination of health teams, and measuring quality through outcomes and process improvement. 8) QAPs and quality of health care should receive more attention from international agencies in terms of research support and coordination of support activities. In addition, international agencies should integrate QAPs in their own programs. 9) More opportunities should be created to evaluate and share experiences from the promotion, design, and implementation of QAPs in all countries. 10) Finally, more research is needed in the application of QAP to primary health care.
