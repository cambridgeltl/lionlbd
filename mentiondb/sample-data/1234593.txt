[Synergism of dicloxacillin and broad-spectrum penicillins].
On the basis of the proved protective activity showed by isoxazolyl penicillins on other antibiotics, a comparative study about the action of dicloxacillin over four penicillins with a broad spectrum was carried on. Either the experiments "in vitro" (antibacterial activity, growth dynamics, determination of beta-lactamase inactivation) then those "in vivo" have proved a real protection. A comparative study on different associations was also performed.
