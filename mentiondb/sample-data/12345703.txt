The SWACH Foundation of India.
The Survival for Women and Children (SWACH) Foundation of India, based in Chandigarh, has as its first objective the improvement of mother and child survival. Some 275 women die in childbirth every day in India, and almost 7000 babies under one year die every day from common diseases such as diarrhoea, pneumonia, measles, and tetanus. More than 7 in every 10 Indian babies are born at home, their births assisted by dais or traditional birth attendants (TBAs) who are often untrained and poorly equipped. SWACH coordinates efforts of nongovernmental organizations that provide mother and child care and family planning services in several Indian states. Birth attendants and nurse-midwives are trained and health services for women and children are enhanced in several hundred villages. The foundation has helped promote innovations such as personal health record cards for mothers and infants, a color-coded weighing balance to help identify low birth weight babies, a mucus extractor to clear the breathing passages of the newborn, and a mask for use when blowing air into the lungs of babies who fail to breathe at birth. SWACH also promotes use of clean delivery kits to increase hygiene during child birth at home. The kits are assembled by women volunteers. SWACH participated in the field-testing of the World Health Organization (WHO) delivery kit and in the production of the WHO TBA training manuals. SWACH supports the education of underprivileged girls in its efforts to improve the status of women, and provides vocational training courses to adolescents in sewing, knitting, and crochet.
