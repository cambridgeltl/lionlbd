Global unmet need: present and future.
About 25% of all married women in developing countries want to space or limit their childbearing but do not have access to the means to do so. Whether or not to practice family planning should be the right of every human. It is clear, however, that when given the choice, many people prefer to space and limit their childbearing in the interest of improving their economic condition, their health, and the health of their children, as well as to secure the best possible education for their children among other reasons. Family planning is an investment in the future which enables people to better control their primary living conditions. Most sexually active people in Africa with unmet need desire to space their childbearing, so reversible methods are called for. There is equal need for birth spacing and birth limiting in Asia and North Africa, while the demand for birth limiting dominates in Latin America. The concept of unmet need has been extremely useful in defining national family planning policies and in prioritizing the need for international assistance. This concept, however, is too quantitative and omits several groups who have or may have an unmet need for family planning. The author discusses the use of unreliable methods, abortion as a family planning method, the unmarried, the potential growth of unmet need, and the need for greater efforts.
