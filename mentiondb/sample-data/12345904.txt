Improving NGO collaboration in AIDS prevention in rural Haiti.
Zanmi Lasante (Health Friends), a nongovernmental organization (NGO) based in rural Haiti, provides an example of the effective role NGOs can play in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention. The group has produced a video, "Chache Lavi, Detwi Lavi," based on the true story of a rural woman who became infected when she migrated to Port-au-Prince to seek employment. The video illustrates the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and broader social issues such as peasants' access to land, political upheaval, and unequal gender relationships. To promote collaboration, Save the Children established the NGO Coalition for the Prevention of AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) in the Central Plateau. Women, particularly adolescent females, are the coalition's target population. Activities have included literacy and income generation training for women, development of algorithms for STD treatment without laboratory diagnosis, a training course for health professionals on STD services and counseling, training of trainers workshops, and preparation of informational materials. The 10 participating NGOs and private voluntary organizations meet quarterly to share information and evaluate programs.
