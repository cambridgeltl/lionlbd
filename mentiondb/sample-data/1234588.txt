[Inhibition of rubella virus hemagglutination by dextran sulfates of high molecular weight].
High molecular weight Destran-sulphates greatly affect rubella virus hemoagglutinin. The inhibition is to be related to the molecular weight. D.S. with p.m. 1,2 X 10(4) show no inhibitory activity, while D.S. 5 X 10(5), and furthermore D.S. p.m. 2 X 10(6) inhibit hemoagglutination. The inhibition appears to be related not to the effect of D.S. on red cells but to the interaction of D.S. with rubella hemoagglutinin. The entity of inhibition is a function of the concentration of D.S. in the test specimen: as much more intense is the former, as much higher is the latter. It is to be noticed however that also relatively little concentrations show to possess a clear inhibitory activity. Concentrations of 0,006 mg/ml and 0 ,05 mg/ml of D.S. (p.m. 2 X 10(6)) cause a lost of hemoagglutinin titre, showing respectively two and four twofold diluition lower titres than controls.
