"In talking to people, simplicity is best".
A trained nurse and midwife explains the origin of her motivation to become involved in family planning and describes the people who have influenced and guided her, her training and experience, and lessons learned over the years. She learned much from her mother who, through ignorance and a lack of health care and quick intervention, lost many children. From the years of practice following her training in England, the author learned that services must be taken to the people and learned about using a community- based distribution approach to promote family planning instead of relying exclusively upon a hospital. It became clear that women could be trained about family planning as well as the causes of high infant mortality like malaria, convulsions, and diarrhea. 171 voluntary village health workers were thus trained in 1979 to provide family planning and treat common illness in Oyo State, easing the entry of family planning into the rural area. 264 male and female vendors in 39 markets in Oyo State were subsequently trained in 1985 to provide family planning education, treatment of common illnesses, oral contraceptives, condoms, foam, and referral for other methods. The author stresses the need, based upon her experience, to discuss menstruation and pregnancy, and the importance of antenatal care, postnatal care, and infant welfare in simple words and notions with families in Nigeria. Although families will not understand the notion of overpopulation, they will acknowledge the need to ensure a mother's health and survival. The author serves on the Technical Advisory Committee for Family Health International's Women's Studies Project.
