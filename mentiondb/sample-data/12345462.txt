Summary of the third session of the ICPD Preparatory Committee: 4-22 April 1994.
The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) is scheduled to be held September 5-13, 1994, in Cairo. The third session of the ICPD Preparatory Committee (PREPCOM) was held April 4-22, 1994, at United Nations headquarters in New York. Delegates spent three weeks negotiating the draft Program of Action to be adopted at the conference in Cairo. Although they agreed on most elements of the Program of Action, the following issues remain unresolved: definitions of "reproductive and sexual health," "reproductive rights," and "safe abortion;" reproductive health services for adolescents; and resource allocation for population and development policies. A brief history of the ICPD is presented and followed by the complete report from and analysis of the third PREPCOM. The text considers what to expect during the intersessional period.
