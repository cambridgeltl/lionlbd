Women's issues. Worldwide they face greatest HIV risk.
According to the Panos report, the male-to-female ratio of HIV cases in North America is 7 to 1, twice the rate of ten years ago. In the Caribbean, the ratio of HIV infections is now almost equal between men and women. In Latin America, infections among women are on the rise and in sub-Saharan Africa, where the transmission of HIV is overwhelmingly heterosexual, more women than men are infected. As more women become HIV-positive, the number of infections in their babies also rises. The simple fact of being married can raise the risk of infection among women, because infidelity is more commonly accepted among men than women. Women cannot always persuade their partners to use condoms, nor do they always have the option of refusing sex. To overcome the problem of noncooperative men, current research is focusing on female-controlled HIV prevention methods, such as female condoms or virus-killing spermicides. The US-based Population Council is also exploring the possibility of developing a virucide or microbicide which could be inserted into the vagina to protect against HIV transmission, while allowing sperm to pass unharmed. However, a product is not likely to appear on the market in the near future. Because there is no immediate prospect of an HIV vaccine or cure, HIV prevention should continue to focus on getting people to change their sexual behavior.
