Slowing AIDS: lessons from a decade of prevention efforts.
Now in the third decade of the AIDS pandemic, much has been learned about the virology and epidemiology of HIV and AIDS, as well as the biological and behavioral factors which enhance its transmission, but neither vaccine nor cure has been developed. Contracting and transmitting HIV can, however, be prevented and is currently the most effective way to control the spread of AIDS. 75% of HIV infections worldwide are the result of sexual intercourse and relations without the use of a condom. Programs designed to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV will therefore have the greatest impact in curbing the progression of the pandemic. Biologically susceptible to infection and more likely to have untreated sexually transmitted diseases (STD) which increase their risk of acquiring HIV, women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. As such, the care and prevention of STDs has become a major element of the overall approach to controlling HIV. In so far as behavior is concerned, much has also been learned from research about why people engage in behavior which puts them at risk of infection and what may be done to change such behavior. It is clear that knowledge of the basic facts of AIDS is insufficient to induce behavioral change. Prevention programs instead need to communicate the benefits of low-risk behavior and provide people with the skills they need to practice safer sex. Behavioral change must then be sustained. Success stories and future challenges are considered.
